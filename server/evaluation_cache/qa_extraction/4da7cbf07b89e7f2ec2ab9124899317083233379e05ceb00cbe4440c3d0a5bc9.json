        "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",

        "student_answer": "b) Explanation for a Product Manager\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a method used to ensure that application data loads quickly and consistently for users.\n\nFunctional Explanation\n\nWhen users search, filter, or view data in an application, indexing allows the system to fetch results faster without delays. Without indexing, the system would need to scan large amounts of data, causing slow response times.\n\nIndexing helps maintain smooth user experiences as the product scales and the data volume increases.\n\nImpact on Product\n\nFaster screen loading and search results\n\nImproved user satisfaction and retention\n\nBetter scalability as user base grows\n\nProduct Manager\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing supports performance-related requirements and helps meet SLAs without changing product features or UI.",
