      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The answer has several major errors. \n1. Only part (a) of the question was attempted; part (b) is missing entirely.\n2. For part (a), while some individual calculations for the log transformation are numerically correct (assuming a base-2 logarithm), they are applied incorrectly. For example, you calculated a value for r=15, which is not in the input image.\n3. The final matrix provided is the wrong size (5x6 instead of 3x6) and its values do not correspond to the correct transformed pixel values.\n\nPlease see the correct answer for the detailed calculations and resulting matrices for both parts."
