      "feedback": "Score: 0.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's code was evaluated for logic, syntax, and algorithmic efficiency. While the high-level algorithm for finding the largest number is conceptually present, the implementation is non-functional due to critical logical and syntactical errors. The reference key's logic requires correctly identifying and printing the largest number. The student's code deviates by attempting to print an undeclared variable 'smallest' and mislabeling the output. Furthermore, the code contains numerous syntax errors (e.g., 'in' instead of 'int', 'size of' instead of 'sizeof', an invalid 'for' loop structure, a missing semicolon) that prevent it from compiling. Due to these severe errors, no credit is awarded."
