      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "For an Engineer, the explanation should cover the technical definition of an index as a data structure (e.g., B-Tree), its purpose in speeding up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans, and the trade-offs, such as increased storage use and slower write operations.\nFor a Product Manager, the focus should be on how indexing improves user experience with faster load times, supports product scalability as data volume grows, and positively impacts user satisfaction and retention.\nFor a Product Salesperson, the explanation should translate the technical feature into customer value, such as reduced waiting times and reliable performance, which serve as business benefits and competitive advantages.\nFor a CEO, the explanation should highlight the strategic importance of indexing for business growth, its impact on scalability and customer satisfaction, and its role in protecting brand reputation and ensuring long-term product quality.",

      "feedback": "The student's answers are correct at a very high level but are critically incomplete. The core requirement of the task was to tailor the explanation with specific details relevant to each role, and this was not achieved. For the Engineer, the answer omits the required discussion of trade-offs (e.g., storage cost, write performance). For the Product Manager, it fails to address scalability and product impact. For the Salesperson and CEO, the answers are generic and do not explain the specific business benefits, customer value, or strategic importance as required by the rubric. The responses lack the depth and differentiation needed to be considered a complete answer."
