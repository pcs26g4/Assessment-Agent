      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "For an Engineer, the explanation should cover the technical definition (e.g., B-Tree data structure), its purpose (to speed up data retrieval and avoid full table scans), and the trade-offs (consumes storage, impacts write operations).\nFor a Product Manager, it should focus on the impact on user experience (faster loading, improved satisfaction), product scalability, and meeting performance SLAs.\nFor a Product Salesperson, it should translate the technical feature into customer value (efficiency, reliability) and business benefits (competitive positioning).\nFor a CEO, it should highlight the strategic importance (protecting brand reputation, supporting growth), scalability, and overall business impact (customer satisfaction, operational efficiency).",

      "feedback": "The student's answers correctly identify the basic purpose of database indexing, which is to make data retrieval faster. However, the responses are far too simplistic and fail to meet the specific requirements for each role as outlined in the question. The answer for the Engineer misses the required discussion of trade-offs. The explanations for the Product Manager, Salesperson, and CEO lack the required focus on product impact, customer value, and strategic importance, respectively. The core task was to tailor the communication with specific details for each audience, which was not achieved."
