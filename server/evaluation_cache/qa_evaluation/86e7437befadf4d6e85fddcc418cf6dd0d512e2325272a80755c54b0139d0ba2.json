Your final resulting set {x_1, x_2, x_5} is correct for a standard alpha-cut where the membership grade must be greater than or equal to 0.7 (\u03bc(x) \u2265 0.7). However, the reasoning shown in your work is flawed. Specifically, your comparison 'x_2 = 0.7 > 0.7' is mathematically incorrect; it should be '0.7 \u2265 0.7' to justify including x_2. Additionally, you used an incorrect value for x_4's membership (0.3 instead of the given 0.5). Since the final answer is correct but the process demonstrates conceptual and factual errors, partial credit is awarded."
