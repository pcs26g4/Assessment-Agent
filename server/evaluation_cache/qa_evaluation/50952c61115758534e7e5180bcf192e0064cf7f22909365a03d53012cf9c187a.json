A correct linear search implementation would iterate from index 0 up to (but not including) the size of the array (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`). The student's code attempts a linear search but contains a critical error in the loop condition (`i <= n`), which leads to an out-of-bounds memory access.",

      "feedback": "Score: 0.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The assignment rubric requires checking the logic for a linear search. While you have attempted to implement a linear search, your code contains a critical logical error. The loop condition `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)` will cause the program to access memory outside the bounds of the array, as the valid indices for an array of size 'n' are from 0 to n-1. The correct condition should be `i < n`. This out-of-bounds error makes the implementation fundamentally incorrect."
