      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The student's answer is conceptually close but notationally incorrect. In Big O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are dropped. Therefore, while the algorithm may take up to n-1 comparisons, this simplifies to O(n). The answer demonstrates an understanding of the linear nature of the search but fails to apply the formal conventions of Big O notation correctly."
