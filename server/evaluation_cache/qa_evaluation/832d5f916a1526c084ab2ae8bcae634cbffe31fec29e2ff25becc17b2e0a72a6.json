The score is 0.0 because the question 'What is the capital of India?' is not part of the assignment description/rubric, which specifies the task is to 'find the largest number'. According to the grading rules, if the question is not found in the assignment description, a score of 0.0 must be awarded. While the answer 'New Delhi' is factually correct for the question asked, the question itself is outside the scope of the assignment."
