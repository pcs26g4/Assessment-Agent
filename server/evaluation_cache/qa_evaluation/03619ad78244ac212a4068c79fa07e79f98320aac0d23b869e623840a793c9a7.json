      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Assignment Description and standard academic correctness. The student provided the correct time complexity for linear search. The answer 'O(n)' accurately represents that in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm may have to iterate through all 'n' elements in the collection, resulting in a linear relationship between the input size and the time taken."
