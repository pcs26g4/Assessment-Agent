      "student_answer": "Name:- Manoj Py\n\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",
      "correct_answer": "The provided reference material shows C code to find the largest number in an array. The logic is as follows:\n1. Initialize an array of integers.\n2. Initialize a variable 'largest' with the first element of the array (arr[0]).\n3. Loop through the array from the second element to the end.\n4. In each iteration, compare the current element with the 'largest' variable.\n5. If the current element is greater than 'largest', update 'largest' to the value of the current element.\n6. After the loop, the 'largest' variable will hold the largest number in the array.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer provides a Python implementation to find the largest number in an array. The logic used\u2014initializing a 'largest' variable with the first element and then iterating through the array to compare and update it\u2014perfectly matches the core logic presented in the C code from the reference material. Although the programming language is different, the algorithm is identical to the one in the answer key, which is permissible. The implementation is correct and successfully finds the largest number."
