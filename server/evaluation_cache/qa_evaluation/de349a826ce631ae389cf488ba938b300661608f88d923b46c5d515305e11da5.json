      "correct_answer": "A correct solution involves initializing a variable to hold the largest value (e.g., the first element of the array) and then iterating through the array. In each iteration, the current element is compared to the stored largest value. If the current element is larger, it replaces the stored value. The student's code correctly implements this algorithm.",

The student's Python code correctly implements a standard algorithm to find the largest number in a list. The logic is sound, the syntax is valid, and the code produces the correct output (99) for the given list."
