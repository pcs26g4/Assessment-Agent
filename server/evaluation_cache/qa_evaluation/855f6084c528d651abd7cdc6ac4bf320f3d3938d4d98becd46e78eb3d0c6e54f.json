While the student's answer '101' is the correct binary equivalent for the number 5, the assignment rubric specifies the task is to 'find the largest number'. According to the grading rules, if the student's work is on a topic not found in the rubric, it must be awarded 0.0. Therefore, no credit is given as the answer does not align with the assignment's core requirement."
