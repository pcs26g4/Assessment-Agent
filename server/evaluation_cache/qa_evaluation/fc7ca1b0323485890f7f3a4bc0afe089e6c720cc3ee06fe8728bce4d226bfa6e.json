      "correct_answer": "The Center of Gravity (COG) or Centroid of Area (COA) method is a defuzzification technique used in fuzzy logic to convert a fuzzy output set into a single crisp numerical value. It calculates the center of the area under the aggregated membership function of the output fuzzy set. The formula is: $COG = \\frac{\\int x \\cdot \\mu(x) dx}{\\int \\mu(x) dx}$, where $x$ is the output variable and $\\mu(x)$ is the membership function of the aggregated fuzzy set.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partial. You correctly provided the integral formula for the Center of Gravity (COG) method. However, points were deducted because the question required a theoretical explanation of the method, not just a formula and a set of unexplained calculations. Your answer lacked conceptual clarity and did not explain what the method is, its purpose (defuzzification), or how it works. The calculations provided were confusing and mixed several different methods without proper context or explanation."
