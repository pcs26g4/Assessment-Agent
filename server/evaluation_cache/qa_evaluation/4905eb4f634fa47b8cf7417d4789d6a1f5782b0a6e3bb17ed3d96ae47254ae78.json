      "correct_answer": "Based on the provided sources, the answer should summarize the key points on business communication, technical communication, and non-verbal cues. \n1. Effective business communication involves understanding communication models (e.g., Oscar model), structuring communication for results, and practicing professional etiquette (grooming, meeting practices).\n2. Technical communication is audience-focused, aiming for clarity and simplicity. It involves audience analysis, strategic inquiry, and creating various content types to make information user-friendly and reduce company costs.\n3. Non-verbal and visual cues, such as hand gestures, pacing, props like glasses, and visual aids like graphs, can be used to create an illusion of expertise, even without substantive content.",
