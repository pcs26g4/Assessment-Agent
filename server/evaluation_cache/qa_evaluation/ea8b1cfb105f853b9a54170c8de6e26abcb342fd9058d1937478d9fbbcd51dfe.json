The evaluation was based on standard mathematical principles (order of operations - PEMDAS/BODMAS) as this question was not present in the provided reference material. The student correctly calculated the multiplication first (2 * 3 = 6) and then the addition (5 + 6 = 11), resulting in the correct answer of 11."
