      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "Engineer: Database indexing is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. The main trade-off is faster read performance (SELECT) versus slower write performance (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and increased disk space usage.\n\nProduct Manager: For our product, implementing proper database indexing directly enhances the user experience by ensuring fast query responses and snappy UI performance. This is crucial for scalability, as it allows the application to maintain performance as user data grows, preventing slowdowns that could lead to user churn and negatively impact product adoption.\n\nProduct Salesperson: Our system's high performance and responsiveness, which is a key customer value proposition, is powered by technologies like database indexing. This translates to a direct business benefit: we can sell a product that is demonstrably faster and more reliable than competitors, leading to higher customer satisfaction and a stronger market position.\n\nCEO: Database indexing is a strategic technical investment that underpins our product's performance and scalability. By ensuring our system can handle a growing user base and data volume without degradation, it directly supports our business growth objectives, protects revenue by preventing customer churn due to poor performance, and reduces long-term operational costs.",

      "feedback": "The student provided a very basic, high-level explanation for each role. While the core idea that indexing improves speed is correct, the answer lacks the depth and specific details required by the question and the rubric. For the Engineer, the required discussion of trade-offs was missing. For the Product Manager, the points on scalability and product impact were not addressed. For the Salesperson and CEO, the explanations did not adequately connect the technical concept to specific business benefits, strategic importance, or impact as required. The answer does not meet the 'comprehensive' and 'depth' criteria from the rubric."
