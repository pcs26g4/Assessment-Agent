      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "A comprehensive answer would be tailored to each role as requested:\n\n- **For an Engineer:** Database indexing is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that improves data retrieval speed on a database table. Its purpose is to minimize the number of disk reads required to locate a specific row of data. The main trade-offs are increased storage overhead and slower write performance (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations) because the index must also be updated.\n\n- **For a Product Manager:** Implementing proper database indexing directly enhances the user experience by making our application faster and more responsive. This is critical for user satisfaction and retention. It also ensures our product is scalable, meaning it can handle a growing amount of data and users without slowing down, which is vital for long-term product success.\n\n- **For a Product Salesperson:** Our platform's speed and responsiveness are key competitive advantages, made possible by our smart use of database indexing. This provides direct customer value by increasing their teams' productivity and efficiency. The business benefit is a smoother, more reliable product that leads to happier customers and stronger renewals.\n\n- **For a CEO:** Database indexing is a strategic technical investment that ensures our platform's performance and scalability. This directly impacts our business by providing a superior customer experience, which is a key market differentiator. It allows us to grow our user base efficiently without a linear increase in infrastructure costs, protecting our margins and supporting long-term, profitable growth.",

      "feedback": "The student has correctly identified the fundamental benefit of database indexing (speed) and has structured the answer for all four required roles. However, the explanations are superficial and lack the specific details and depth required by the question. For instance, the explanation for the Engineer misses the critical 'trade-offs' component. The answers for the Product Manager and CEO fail to adequately address concepts like 'scalability', 'product impact', and 'business impact'. The response demonstrates a basic understanding but does not meet the question's requirement for comprehensive, role-specific explanations."
