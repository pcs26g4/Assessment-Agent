      "correct_answer": "The reference material provides two examples for finding the largest number in a list/array. One is a correct Python implementation. The other is a C implementation that contains multiple syntax and logic errors, such as `in n = size of(arr)`, an invalid `for` loop initialization, and an incorrect `printf` statement that tries to print an undefined variable `smallest`.",

      "feedback": "The student's submission is a substantive match to the C code provided in the reference material (document ddafe209-4e88-42b7-afc5-1a153964fc06.pdf). The student's code contains many of the same syntax and logic errors present in that reference document, including the incorrect variable declaration `in n = size of(arr)` and the final `printf` statement which incorrectly attempts to print an undefined variable `smallest`. According to the grading rules, a submission that substantively matches any part of the reference set receives full credit. Therefore, the answer is marked as correct."
