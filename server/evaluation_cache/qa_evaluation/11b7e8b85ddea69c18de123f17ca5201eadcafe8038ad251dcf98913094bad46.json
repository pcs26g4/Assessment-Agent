      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against the Assignment Description. The requirement was to check the logic for finding the largest number in an array. The student's code correctly implements a standard algorithm for this task by initializing a 'largest' variable, iterating through the array, and updating the variable when a larger number is found. The logic is sound and correctly implemented."
