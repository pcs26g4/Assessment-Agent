      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The correct answer should define the concept. Scalar Cardinality of a fuzzy set A is the sum of the membership values of all the elements in the set. It is calculated using the formula: |A| = \u2211_{x\u2208X} \u03bc_A(x), where \u03bc_A(x) is the membership function of the fuzzy set A. Your answer is incoherent and does not provide a clear definition. While it contains the correct summation formula, it is surrounded by irrelevant numbers and nonsensical expressions, demonstrating a lack of conceptual understanding."
