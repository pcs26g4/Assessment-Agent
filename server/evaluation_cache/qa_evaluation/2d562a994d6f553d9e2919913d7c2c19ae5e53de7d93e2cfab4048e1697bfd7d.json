      "correct_answer": "A correct implementation would initialize a 'largest' variable with the first element of the array, then loop through the remaining elements. Inside the loop, it would compare the current element with the 'largest' variable and update 'largest' if the current element is greater. Finally, it should print the 'largest' variable. The code must be syntactically correct to be functional.",

      "feedback": "Score: 0.0/1.0. Graded against the Assignment Description. The assignment was to check the logic for finding the largest number in an array. While the conceptual loop structure is partially visible, the implementation has critical errors. There are numerous syntax errors (e.g., 'in n = size of', 'for init', 'largest.') that would prevent the code from compiling. More importantly, there is a major logical flaw: after calculating the 'largest' value, the code attempts to print an undeclared variable named 'smallest' with the label \"Smallest number\". This final step contradicts the entire purpose of the algorithm. Due to the non-functional code and the fundamental logical error in the output, no credit can be awarded."
