The student's answer was evaluated using standard academic knowledge because the provided reference material (a Python script for finding the largest number in an array) and the stated subject (BIOLOGY) were entirely unrelated to the question about web protocols. The student correctly identified HTTPS as the protocol used for secure web browsing."
