The formula explicitly has a stride of `3` in the denominator, but the student incorrectly used `s=1` in their calculation. Although the final numerical result is coincidentally correct, the method shown is wrong because it deviates from the given equation. The correct calculation is: output size = (\\frac{5+2(1)-7}{3} + 1) x (\\frac{5+2(1)-7}{3} + 1) = 1 x 1 = 1."
