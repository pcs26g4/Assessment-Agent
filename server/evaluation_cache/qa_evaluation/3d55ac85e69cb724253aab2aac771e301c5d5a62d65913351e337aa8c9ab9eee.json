      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The correct formula is Output = (Input - Filter + 2*Padding) / Stride + 1. You wrote the formula with an incorrect denominator ('Stride + 2' instead of 'Stride'). However, your numerical calculation `(63-7+2*0)/2+1=29` was performed correctly, as if you had used the correct formula. The final step of calculating the output volume as `29x29x32` is also conceptually correct. Points were deducted for the significant error in the written theoretical formula."
