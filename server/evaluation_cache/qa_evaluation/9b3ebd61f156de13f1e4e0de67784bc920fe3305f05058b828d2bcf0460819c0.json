      "question": "check the logic for the largest number in an array",
      "student_answer": "Name:- Manoj Py\n\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",
      "correct_answer": "The logic involves initializing a variable, 'largest', with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the rest of the array elements starting from the second element. In each iteration, compare the current element with the 'largest' variable. If the current element is greater, update 'largest' with the value of the current element. After the loop finishes, the 'largest' variable will hold the largest number in the array.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's logic for finding the largest number in an array is correct. The provided Python code correctly initializes a 'largest' variable with the first element and then iterates through the array, updating the variable whenever a larger element is found. This logic is functionally identical to the C code logic provided in the reference material. The use of a different programming language is acceptable as the core algorithm is the same."
