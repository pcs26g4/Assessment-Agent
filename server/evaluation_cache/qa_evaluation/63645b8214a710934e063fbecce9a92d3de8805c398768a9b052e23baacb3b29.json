      "correct_answer": "The question is incomplete as it does not specify the number of hidden layers or what needs to be calculated. Assuming the goal is to define a network with one hidden layer (e.g., 5 neurons, as implied by the student's answer) and state the weight matrix dimensions, the matrices would be: a 5x6 matrix for weights between the input and hidden layer, and a 2x5 matrix for weights between the hidden and output layer.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The answer is largely incoherent and illegible, which fails the conceptual clarity requirement. The student introduces a hidden layer not mentioned in the question and provides a nonsensical calculation ('Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p'). While the final matrix dimensions '[2x5]; [5x6]' could correspond to a valid network architecture, they are presented without any clear derivation or context, and the surrounding text is incomprehensible."
