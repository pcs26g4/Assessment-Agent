      "correct_answer": "The correct formula to calculate the output height or width is: Output = ((Input - Filter + 2 * Padding) / Stride) + 1. Given the values from the calculation (Input=63, Filter=7, Padding=0, Stride=2), the calculation is: ((63 - 7 + 2*0) / 2) + 1 = (56 / 2) + 1 = 28 + 1 = 29. The final output dimensions are 29x29x32.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The correct formula is `Output = ((Input - Filter + 2 * Padding) / Stride) + 1`. You wrote the formula with `+2` at the end, which is incorrect. However, your numerical calculation correctly used `+1` and arrived at the correct dimension of 29. The final output shape of 29x29x32 is correct. Points were deducted for stating the incorrect formula."
