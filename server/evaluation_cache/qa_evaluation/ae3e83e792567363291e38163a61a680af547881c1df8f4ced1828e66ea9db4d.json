      "correct_answer": "The question is incomplete as it does not specify the architecture of the hidden layer(s). Assuming a single hidden layer with 'h' neurons, the dimensions of the weight matrices would be: W1 (Input to Hidden) of size [h x 6] and W2 (Hidden to Output) of size [2 x h].",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. You correctly identified the dimensional structure of the weight matrices, [2x5] and [5x6], which implies a hidden layer of 5 neurons. However, the question did not specify a hidden layer, so you had to make an assumption. Additionally, the formula you wrote, 'Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p', is incorrect. The correct dimension for a weight matrix is (number of neurons in the next layer) x (number of neurons in the current layer). The rest of the text was illegible."
