      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct\n\nThe correct answer is: The formula to calculate the output size is `O = (W - K + 2P) / S + 1`. Assuming no padding (P=0), the calculation is `(28 - 7 + 2*0) / 1 + 1 = 22`. The correct output size is 22x22.\n\nReasoning for deduction: While your final calculated output size of 22x22 is correct, the formula you provided, `(i/p size - kenral size) / stride`, is conceptually incorrect as it is missing the `+1` term. Your subsequent calculation `28-7+1 = 22` does lead to the correct result for this specific case (stride=1, padding=0), but it does not match the incorrect formula you stated. Points were deducted for the incorrect theoretical formula."
