      "correct_answer": "The correct logic for a linear search involves iterating through the array from the first element to the last. The loop condition should be `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)` to avoid an out-of-bounds error. Inside the loop, each element is compared to the target value. If a match is found, the index is reported, and the search can terminate. If the loop completes without a match, the target is not in the array.",

The provided reference material was about finding the largest element and was disregarded as it was not relevant to the question about linear search. The student's code was evaluated for its correctness in implementing a linear search. The logic is incorrect due to a critical error in the for loop condition. The condition `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)` will cause the loop to access an element outside the array's bounds (arr[5]), which is undefined behavior. The correct condition should be `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`. This is a fundamental logic error, not a minor syntax issue."
