      "feedback": "Assessment: Correct. The question as written is incomplete, as it only defines a fuzzy set without specifying an operation. However, your answer correctly performs an \u03b1-cut for \u03b1 = 0.7, which is a logical interpretation of the implied task. Your step-by-step evaluation for each element is correct, leading to the correct final set."
