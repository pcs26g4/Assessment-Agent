However, the reference material itself contains significant syntax and logical errors. The core logic for iterating through the array and comparing values to find the largest number is conceptually present, which warrants partial credit. Points were deducted for multiple critical errors that were replicated from the reference: 1) Numerous syntax errors (e.g., 'in n', 'size of', 'for init', 'largest.'). 2) A major logical error in the final line, which attempts to print a different, undefined variable ('smallest') with the wrong format specifier ('%.f') and an incorrect label ('Smallest number:')."
