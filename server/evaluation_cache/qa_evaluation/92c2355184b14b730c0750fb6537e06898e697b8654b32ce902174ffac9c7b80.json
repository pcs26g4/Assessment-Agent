      "correct_answer": "Assuming a direct connection between the input and output layers (a simple perceptron model with no hidden layers), the weight matrix would have dimensions of (number of output neurons) x (number of input neurons). Therefore, the dimensions of the weight matrix are 2x6. The bias vector would have 2 elements.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The student's answer is largely illegible and based on incorrect assumptions. The question describes a simple network with a 6-neuron input layer and a 2-neuron output layer. The student's answer incorrectly introduces a hidden layer of 5 neurons, which was not specified in the question. This fundamentally changes the problem and leads to an incorrect answer for the question as it was posed. Additionally, the formula 'Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p' is conceptually wrong."
