The specific question asked ('Which data structure follows LIFO?') was not present in the provided reference material, which lists a different question for Q6. Therefore, the answer was evaluated based on standard academic knowledge. The student correctly identified that a 'Stack' is the data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle."
