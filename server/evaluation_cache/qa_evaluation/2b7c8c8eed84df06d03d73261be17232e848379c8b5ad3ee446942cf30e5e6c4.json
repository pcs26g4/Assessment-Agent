      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The final answer of 22x22 is correct, and the calculation steps shown (28 - 7 + 1 = 22) are also correct. However, points were deducted because the formula you wrote, `(i/p size - kernal size) / stride`, is incorrect. The correct formula is `((Input Size - Kernel Size) / Stride) + 1`. In a theory assessment, providing the correct underlying formula is crucial for demonstrating conceptual understanding."
