      "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct explanation for an engineer should define an index as a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that improves data retrieval speed. Its purpose is to allow the database engine to find rows quickly without a full table scan, especially for queries with WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses. The trade-offs include increased storage consumption and performance overhead on write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to the need to maintain the index.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against the Assignment Description and standard academic correctness. The student's answer is excellent and fully meets all requirements of the question and the rubric. It provides a clear definition of database indexing, explains its purpose in speeding up data retrieval, and accurately lists the key trade-offs (storage space, write performance). The explanation is perfectly tailored for an engineer, using appropriate technical terms like 'B-Tree', 'full table scan', and 'query execution plans'. The answer demonstrates strong conceptual clarity, depth, and keyword accuracy."
