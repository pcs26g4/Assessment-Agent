      "feedback": "The provided reference material was not relevant to this question. The student's answer was evaluated based on standard correctness for implementing a linear search algorithm in Python. The student's code is a correct and standard implementation of linear search. It correctly iterates through the list, compares each element with the target, and returns the index if found, or -1 otherwise."
