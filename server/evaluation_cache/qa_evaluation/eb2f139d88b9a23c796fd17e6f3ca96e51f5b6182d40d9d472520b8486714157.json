      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The score is 1.0 because the submitted code correctly implements the logic for finding the largest number in a list, which aligns with the requirement to 'check the logic for the largest number'. The algorithm correctly initializes a 'largest' variable, iterates through the list, and updates the variable when a larger number is encountered. The logic is sound and complete."
