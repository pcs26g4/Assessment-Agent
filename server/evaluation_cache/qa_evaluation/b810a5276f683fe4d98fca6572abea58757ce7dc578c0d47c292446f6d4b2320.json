      "correct_answer": "A correct implementation involves initializing a variable with the first element of the array, then iterating through the remaining elements. If an element is found to be greater than the current largest value, the variable is updated with that element's value. The final value of the variable will be the largest number in the array.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student has provided a correct and functional algorithm to find the largest number in an array. The code correctly initializes a variable to hold the largest value, iterates through the list, and updates the variable whenever a larger number is found. The implementation is logically sound and syntactically correct."
