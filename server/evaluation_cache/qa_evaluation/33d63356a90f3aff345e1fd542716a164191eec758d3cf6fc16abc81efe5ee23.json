      "correct_answer": "Database indexing is a data structure technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. An index works similarly to a lookup table, allowing the database engine to locate rows efficiently without performing a full table scan. Indexes are typically implemented using data structures such as B-trees or hash tables. While indexing improves read performance, it introduces overhead during write operations.",
