      "question": "[CATEGORY: THEORY] check the logic for the largest number",
      "student_answer": "Name:- Manoj Py\n\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",
      "correct_answer": "The correct logic involves initializing a variable with the first element of the array, then iterating through the array and comparing each element to the current largest value. If an element is larger, it becomes the new largest value. The provided reference material shows the logic for the smallest number, not the largest.",
      "is_correct": true,
      "partial_credit": 1.0,
      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The student correctly provided the logic for finding the largest number in an array, which directly answers the question. The provided algorithm is standard and correct. Although the reference material demonstrates finding the smallest number, the student correctly addressed the actual question posed."
