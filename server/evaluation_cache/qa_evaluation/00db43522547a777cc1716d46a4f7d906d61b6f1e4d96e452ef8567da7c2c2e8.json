      "feedback": "Score: 0.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer provides a correct implementation of a linear search. However, the official reference material/answer key provided for this assignment contains code to find the largest number in an array. According to the grading rules, the student's answer must match the logic of the reference material. Since the logic for linear search is completely different from the logic for finding the largest number, no credit can be awarded."
