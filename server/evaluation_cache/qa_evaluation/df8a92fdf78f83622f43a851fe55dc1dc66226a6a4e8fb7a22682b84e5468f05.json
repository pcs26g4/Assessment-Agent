      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "Engineer: A technical explanation of indexing as a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that speeds up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans, while noting trade-offs like increased storage and slower write operations.\nProduct Manager: An explanation focused on how indexing improves user experience through faster load times and searches, ensuring product scalability and user retention.\nProduct Salesperson: A business-oriented explanation of how indexing provides customer value through a fast, reliable product, which enhances the product's credibility and competitive position.\nCEO: A strategic explanation of how indexing is a foundational investment that supports business growth, protects brand reputation, and ensures long-term scalability and customer satisfaction.",

      "feedback": "The student's answers are factually correct at a very high level but are extremely superficial and fail to meet the specific requirements for each role as outlined in the question and the rubric. For the Engineer, the answer omits the required discussion of trade-offs. For the Product Manager, it fails to address scalability and product impact. For the Salesperson, it does not explain customer value or business benefits. For the CEO, it misses the strategic importance, scalability, and business impact. Because the core requirements for each tailored explanation were not addressed, the answer is incorrect."
