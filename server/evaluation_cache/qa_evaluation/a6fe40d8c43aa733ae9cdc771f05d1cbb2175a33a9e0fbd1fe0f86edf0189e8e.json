      "correct_answer": "The correct logic involves initializing a variable `largest` with the first element of the array, then iterating through the rest of the array. In each iteration, if the current element `arr[i]` is greater than `largest`, `largest` is updated to `arr[i]`. A correct C implementation would look like:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {10, 45, 3, 99, 23};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int largest = arr[0];\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        if (arr[i] > largest) {\n            largest = arr[i];\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"Largest number: %d\", largest);\n    return 0;\n}",

      "feedback": "Score: 0.25/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. Partial credit is awarded because the core logical comparison `if (arr[i] > largest)` is conceptually correct for finding the largest number, which addresses the question's prompt. However, the score is significantly reduced because the provided code has numerous critical syntax and logical errors that render it non-functional and internally inconsistent. Major errors include: 1) Invalid syntax for calculating the array size (`in n = size of...`). 2) A completely malformed `for` loop (`for init (i=);`). 3) A syntax error in the `if` condition (`largest.`). 4) A missing semicolon. 5) The final `printf` statement is entirely incorrect, as it attempts to print \"Smallest number\" and uses an undeclared variable `smallest`, which contradicts the program's objective."
