      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct answer would provide detailed, role-specific explanations. For example:\n\nEngineer: Database indexing is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that improves data retrieval speed by creating a sorted map of key values. Its purpose is to avoid full table scans. The key trade-offs are increased storage overhead and slower write performance (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must also be updated.\n\nProduct Manager: Indexing is crucial for user experience, as it ensures our application's features load quickly, even as data grows. This directly impacts scalability, allowing us to serve more users without performance degradation, which in turn boosts user satisfaction and retention.\n\nProduct Salesperson: Our platform's speed and responsiveness are a key competitive advantage, thanks to technologies like database indexing. This provides direct customer value by eliminating frustrating wait times, which translates to the business benefit of higher user adoption and a reputation for reliability.\n\nCEO: Database indexing is a strategic technical investment that ensures our platform's performance can scale with our business growth. It directly impacts our bottom line by enabling us to handle a larger user base efficiently, which is critical for market expansion, customer retention, and long-term profitability.",

      "feedback": "The student has a basic understanding that database indexing improves performance. However, the answer severely lacks the depth, detail, and specific points required for each role as outlined in the question and expected by the rubric. Each explanation is a single, superficial sentence that fails to address the specific keywords and concepts required (e.g., 'trade-offs' for the Engineer, 'scalability' for the PM and CEO, 'business benefits' for the Salesperson). The explanations are not substantially differentiated beyond simple rephrasing. Credit is awarded for the core concept, but significant marks are deducted for failing to meet the detailed requirements of the task."
