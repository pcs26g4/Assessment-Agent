      "feedback": "The student's code attempts to find the largest number in an array, but it contains multiple critical syntax and logical errors that make it non-functional. Graded against Reference Key.\n\nErrors include:\n1.  **Syntax Errors:** The code will not compile. Examples: `in` should be `int`, `size of` should be `sizeof`, the `for` loop syntax `for init (i=);` is invalid, there is an extra period in `largest.`, and a semicolon is missing after `largest = arr[i]`.\n2.  **Logical Error:** The final `printf` statement is incorrect. It attempts to print a variable named `smallest` which was never declared, and it labels the output as \"Smallest number:\" when the goal was to find the largest."
