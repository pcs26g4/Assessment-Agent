      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. Your answer correctly identifies the pattern for weight matrix dimensions based on your assumption of a 5-neuron hidden layer, resulting in plausible dimensions of 5x6 and 2x5. However, the question did not specify the size of the hidden layer, so you made an assumption. More importantly, the formula you wrote, 'Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p', is conceptually incorrect. The correct rule is that a weight matrix connecting layer L-1 to layer L has dimensions (number of neurons in L) x (number of neurons in L-1)."
