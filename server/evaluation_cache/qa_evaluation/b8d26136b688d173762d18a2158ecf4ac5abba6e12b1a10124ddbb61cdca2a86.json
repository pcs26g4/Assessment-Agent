      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer provides the logic for finding the largest number in an array, which substantively matches the logic presented in the reference material. The core algorithm of initializing a 'largest' variable and iterating through the array to find a greater value is identical to the key. Full credit is awarded for correctly replicating the required logic. Note that both the student's answer and the reference key contain syntax errors and a logically incorrect final print statement, but the core logic requested by the question is present and matches the key."
