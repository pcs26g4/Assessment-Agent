      "correct_answer": "A correct implementation of a linear search algorithm. The program should iterate through a list or array, comparing each element to a target value. If the value is found, it should report the index. If the entire list is traversed without finding the value, it should indicate that the element was not found.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer was evaluated against the assignment description in the rubric category, which required writing a program for a linear search. The provided reference material for Q1 was on a different topic (database indexing) and was therefore considered irrelevant to this task. The student's Python code is a correct and functional implementation of the linear search algorithm. It successfully iterates through the list, finds the target element, and reports its index, correctly handling the case where the element is not found."
