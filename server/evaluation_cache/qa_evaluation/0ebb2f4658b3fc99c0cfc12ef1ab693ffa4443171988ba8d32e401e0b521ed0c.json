      "correct_answer": "The correct logic for a linear search involves iterating through each element of a collection one by one and comparing it to a target value. If the target value is found, the search is successful and typically returns the index of the element. If the end of the collection is reached without finding the target, the search is unsuccessful. The provided C code in the reference material is for finding the largest element, not for a linear search.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The question asked for the logic of a linear search. The provided reference material was for a different problem (finding the largest element) and was therefore deemed irrelevant to the specific question asked, as per the grading instructions. The student's answer correctly implements the logic for a linear search in C++. The code successfully iterates through the array, compares each element to the target, and correctly reports whether the element is found and at what index."
