      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "For an Engineer: Explain indexing as a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that speeds up reads by avoiding full table scans, but mention the trade-offs of increased storage and slower write operations.\nFor a Product Manager: Focus on how indexing improves user experience through faster load times and search results, ensuring the product remains scalable as data grows.\nFor a Product Salesperson: Frame indexing as a key feature that provides customer value through a fast, reliable, and performant product, which is a competitive advantage.\nFor a CEO: Explain indexing as a strategic investment that supports business scalability, enhances customer satisfaction, protects brand reputation, and enables long-term growth.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is incorrect because it fails to meet the specific requirements for each role as outlined in the question and rubric. The provided answers are overly simplistic, one-line statements that lack the required depth and detail. For the Engineer, the explanation omits the crucial discussion of trade-offs (storage, write performance). For the Product Manager, it fails to connect indexing to scalability and product impact. For the Salesperson, it doesn't articulate customer value or business benefits. For the CEO, it completely misses the strategic importance and business impact. The task required detailed, tailored explanations, not brief taglines."
