      "student_answer": "b) Explanation for a Product Manager\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a method used to ensure that application data loads quickly and consistently for users.\n\nFunctional Explanation\n\nWhen users search, filter, or view data in an application, indexing allows the system to fetch results faster without delays. Without indexing, the system would need to scan large amounts of data, causing slow response times.\n\nIndexing helps maintain smooth user experiences as the product scales and the data volume increases.\n\nImpact on Product\n\nFaster screen loading and search results\n\nImproved user satisfaction and retention\n\nBetter scalability as user base grows\n\nProduct Manager\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing supports performance-related requirements and helps meet SLAs without changing product features or UI.",
      "correct_answer": "The provided reference material contains a Java code snippet for detecting a cycle in a linked list using the fast and slow pointer method. The correct implementation should advance the fast pointer by two steps (`fast = fast.next.next;`), not one.",
