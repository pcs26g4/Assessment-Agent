      "student_answer": "b) Explanation for a Product Manager\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a method used to ensure that application data loads quickly and consistently for users.\n\nFunctional Explanation\n\nWhen users search, filter, or view data in an application, indexing allows the system to fetch results faster without delays. Without indexing, the system would need to scan large amounts of data, causing slow response times.\n\nIndexing helps maintain smooth user experiences as the product scales and the data volume increases.\n\nImpact on Product\n\nFaster screen loading and search results\n\nImproved user satisfaction and retention\n\nBetter scalability as user base grows\n\nProduct Manager\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing supports performance-related requirements and helps meet SLAs without changing product features or UI.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct answer should explain database indexing in non-technical terms, focusing on its benefits for a product. It should connect indexing to faster data retrieval, which leads to improved user experience (e.g., quicker search results, faster page loads). It must also address scalability, explaining that as the amount of data grows, indexing becomes crucial to maintain performance. Finally, it should summarize the product impact, such as increased user satisfaction, better retention, and meeting performance-related service-level agreements (SLAs).",
