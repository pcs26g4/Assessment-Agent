Later in the talk, he emphasizes that he is gesticulating and pacing as though he is building to some sort of satisfying conclusion, while simultaneously \"growing in intensity\".\n\n\u2022 Beckoning: He uses a forceful visual cue, stating he will \"really beckon\" to make a point seem intellectual.\n\n\u2022 Changing Tone and Pace: To create the impression of a significant moment, the speaker slows down the delivery and changes the tone, making it seem like he is \"building to a moment\".\n\nAttire and Props\n\n\u2022 Glasses: The speaker uses glasses as a prop to visually project intelligence. He admits he wore them \"to look smart,\" even though they are merely frames and his vision is perfect. He uses them non-verbally by adjusting his glasses and later dramatically taking them off as he slows the talk down.\n\nVisual Aids and Data\n\nThe speaker utilizes visual aids to give the impression that he has performed the necessary preparation and research, or \"done [his] homework\".\n\n\u2022 Slides and Background Images: The presentation includes slides that feature \"words paired with vaguely thought-provoking stock photos\". The speaker actively points at these images to create the appearance of making effective use of time. He also incorporates an image of a man found by googling the word \"Scientist\" to give the discussion intellectual weight.\n\n\u2022 Graphs and Charts: Graphs are used to display irrelevant data, including a pie chart that simply shows \"that the majority far exceeds the minority,\" and a bar graph showing \"similarly irrelevant data\".\n\n\u2022 Numbers: He presents various real numbers, such as measurements, mathematical facts (2x6=12), and large quantities (2.6 million), which serve as filler and contribute to the appearance of using data.\n\nThe speaker notes that these collective non-verbal cues are so effective that if someone were watching the video on YouTube \"with the sound off,\" they might automatically assume, \"This guy knows what he's talking about",
