      "question": "Q5: What is the time complexity of linear search?",
      "student_answer": "Answer: O(n)",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is correct. This question was not found in the provided reference material and was evaluated based on standard academic knowledge. The worst-case and average-case time complexity for a linear search is O(n), as the algorithm may have to examine every element in a list of size n. The student provided the correct Big O notation."
