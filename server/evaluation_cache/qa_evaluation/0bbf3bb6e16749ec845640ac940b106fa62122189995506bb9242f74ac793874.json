      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The provided code contains a critical logical error that prevents it from correctly detecting a cycle. The core of Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm is that the 'fast' pointer moves twice as fast as the 'slow' pointer. In your code, the line `fast = fast.next;` moves the fast pointer at the same speed as the slow pointer, making the algorithm non-functional. While you correctly identified the issue in your comment `// should be fast.next.next`, the submitted code is incorrect as it stands."
