While the answer '101' is the correct binary representation for the number 5, the question falls outside the scope of the assignment. The rubric explicitly requires a THEORY assessment for BIOLOGY. This question pertains to mathematics/computer science, not biology, and therefore does not demonstrate the required knowledge for this assessment."
