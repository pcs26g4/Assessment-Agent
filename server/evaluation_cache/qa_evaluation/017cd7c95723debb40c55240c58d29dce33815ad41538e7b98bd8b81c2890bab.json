      "correct_answer": "The question has two parts. \nPart (a) requires a log transformation s = c * log(1+r). With c=1 and using log base 2 (as implied by the reference key's calculations), the formula is s = log\u2082(1+r). The correct output matrix for part (a) is:\n| 1.00 | 1.58 | 1.00 | 2.58 | 4.58 | 2.58 |\n| 2.32 | 2.00 | 3.00 | 3.17 | 3.32 | 0.00 |\n| 2.00 | 2.58 | 3.32 | 3.00 | 3.46 | 3.70 |\n\nPart (b) requires a power-law transformation s = c * r^\u03b3. The reference key indicates c=2 and \u03b3=0.005. The reference key provides the following matrix as the answer for part (b), although its dimensions (5x6) do not match the input image's dimensions (3x6):\n| 2 | 2.06 | 2 | 2.39 | 2.06 | 28 |\n| 2.14 | 2.11 | 2.23 | 2.26 | 2.28 | 0 |\n| 2.11 | 2.18 | 2.28 | 2.23 | 2.30 | 2.34 |\n| 2.39 | 2.34 | 2.28 | 2.26 | 2.14 | 2.36 |\n| 2.11 | 2.06 | 2 | 0 | 2.37 | 0 |",

      "feedback": "Graded against Reference Key. The student's answer is incomplete and incorrectly combines the two parts of the question. The student provided some calculations for the log transformation (part a) that match the reference key, but failed to provide the final output matrix for part (a). The matrix provided by the student is a verbatim copy of the matrix from the reference key, which corresponds to the power-law transformation (part b). However, no calculations were shown for part (b). The answer is considered partially correct because it contains correct elements from the reference key, but it fails to provide a complete and distinct solution for each part of the question."
