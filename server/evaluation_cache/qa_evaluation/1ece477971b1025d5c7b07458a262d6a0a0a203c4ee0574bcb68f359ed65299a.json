The rubric specifies the task is to 'find the largest number', but the question is about a Python keyword. According to the grading rules, if the student's work is on a topic not found in the reference material, it must receive a score of 0.0. While the answer 'def' is correct for the question asked, the question itself does not align with the assignment's requirements."
