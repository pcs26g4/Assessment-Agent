      "correct_answer": "The formula to calculate the output height or width of a convolutional layer is: Output Dimension = (Input Dimension - Filter Size + 2 * Padding) / Stride + 1. For the given values (Input=63, Filter=7, Padding=0, Stride=2), the calculation is: (63 - 7 + 2*0) / 2 + 1 = 29. The output volume would be 29x29x[Depth].",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The correct formula is Output = (Input - Filter + 2 * Padding) / Stride + 1. You wrote the formula with 'Stride + 2' in the denominator, which is incorrect. However, your numerical calculation was performed correctly using the right formula, leading to the correct result of 29. Because the theoretical formula was stated incorrectly, full marks cannot be awarded."
