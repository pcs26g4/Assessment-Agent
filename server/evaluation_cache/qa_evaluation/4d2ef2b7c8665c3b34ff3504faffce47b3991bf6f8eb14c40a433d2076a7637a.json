The provided C++ code is a direct logical equivalent of the Python code in the reference material. It correctly implements a linear search algorithm to find the target value within the specified array and handles both the 'found' and 'not found' cases, mirroring the logic of the answer key. The use of a different programming language is acceptable as the core logic is identical."
