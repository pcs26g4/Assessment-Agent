      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The correct answer is that the weight matrix connecting the 6-neuron input layer to the 2-neuron output layer would have dimensions of 2x6. Your answer is incorrect because you introduced a 'hidden layer' with 5 neurons, which was not specified in the question. The calculation provided ('Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p') is also conceptually wrong."
