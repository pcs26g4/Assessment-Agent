      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "For an Engineer: Explain that indexing is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that speeds up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans. Mention the purpose is to improve read performance for queries. Crucially, include the trade-offs: it consumes extra storage and slows down write operations.\nFor a Product Manager: Focus on how indexing improves user experience by ensuring data loads quickly, leading to better user satisfaction and retention. Explain its impact on product scalability, allowing the application to perform well as data volume grows.\nFor a Product Salesperson: Frame indexing as a feature that provides direct customer value through faster operations and a reliable user experience. Explain the business benefit is a more credible and competitive product.\nFor a CEO: Describe indexing as a strategic investment. Explain its importance for scalability and growth, its business impact on customer satisfaction and brand reputation, and how it supports business efficiency.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is incorrect. While the statements are not factually wrong, they are extremely superficial and fail to meet the specific requirements for each role as outlined in the question. The explanations lack the required depth, detail, and tailoring. For the Engineer, there is no mention of trade-offs. For the Product Manager, scalability and product impact are not addressed. For the Salesperson, customer value and business benefits are not clearly articulated. For the CEO, the strategic importance and business impact are completely missing. The answer does not demonstrate an understanding of how to communicate a technical concept to different audiences."
