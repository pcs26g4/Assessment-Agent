      "correct_answer": "In fuzzy set theory, the relative cardinality of a fuzzy set A is the ratio of its scalar cardinality to the cardinality of the universal set X. The formula is: Relative Cardinality = |A| / |X|, where |A| is the sum of the membership degrees of all elements in the fuzzy set, and |X| is the total number of elements in the universal set.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. You correctly stated the formula for relative cardinality as 'Scalar Cardinality / No. of elements'. However, the remainder of your answer consists of nonsensical calculations, symbols, and irrelevant text that demonstrate a profound lack of conceptual clarity. To receive full credit, you must provide a clear definition and avoid including incorrect or incomprehensible information."
