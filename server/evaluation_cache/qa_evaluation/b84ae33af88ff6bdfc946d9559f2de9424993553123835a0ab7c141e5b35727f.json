      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct answer would provide detailed, role-specific explanations. For example:\n\nEngineer: Database indexing is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. Its purpose is to minimize disk I/O by allowing the database to find a row without scanning the entire table. The trade-offs are increased storage space for the index itself and slower write performance (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) as the index must also be updated.\n\nProduct Manager: Indexing is a key technical feature that directly enhances user experience by ensuring features like search, filtering, and reporting are fast and responsive. This boosts user engagement and satisfaction. Strategically, it ensures our product can scale to handle more data and users without performance degradation, which is critical for long-term viability and supporting future feature development.\n\nProduct Salesperson: Our platform's speed and responsiveness, a key benefit for our customers, is powered by smart database indexing. This translates directly to increased productivity for your team, as they aren't left waiting for data to load. This performance advantage makes our solution more efficient and valuable than competitors.\n\nCEO: Database indexing is a foundational technical investment that ensures our product's performance and scalability. This directly supports our strategic goals by driving customer retention through a superior user experience and enabling us to grow our user base without incurring massive infrastructure costs. It's a key enabler of our long-term profitability and market leadership.",

      "feedback": "Score: 0.25/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The provided reference material was on an unrelated topic (C programming) and was ignored as per the grading instructions. The evaluation was based on the assignment description's requirement for a 'comprehensive THEORY assessment' with 'conceptual clarity, depth, and keyword accuracy'. While you correctly identified the basic concept of indexing (improving speed) and attempted to tailor it for each role, the answers are extremely superficial and lack the required depth and specific points requested in the question. For example, you missed mentioning trade-offs for the Engineer, scalability for the Product Manager, and detailed business impact for the CEO. The answers are too brief to be considered a comprehensive explanation."
