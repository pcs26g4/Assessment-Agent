      "correct_answer": "A correct solution should implement an algorithm to find the maximum value in a list. The standard approach is to initialize a variable to hold the largest value (e.g., with the first element) and then iterate through the list, updating this variable whenever a larger element is found. The provided code correctly implements this logic with optimal efficiency.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against the Assignment Description. The submitted code was evaluated for logic, syntax, and algorithmic efficiency. The logic for finding the largest number in the array is correct. The Python syntax is valid and the code runs without errors. The algorithm used is a linear scan (O(n) time complexity), which is optimally efficient for this problem. The submission meets all requirements."
