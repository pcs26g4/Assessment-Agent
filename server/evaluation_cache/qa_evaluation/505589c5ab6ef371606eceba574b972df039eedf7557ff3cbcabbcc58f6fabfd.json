      "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",
      "correct_answer": "For an Engineer:\n\nDefinition: A database index is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree, Hash) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works by creating a separate copy of selected columns, which is sorted to enable rapid lookups, similar to an index in a book.\n\nPurpose: The primary purpose is to accelerate query performance by allowing the database engine to find rows matching WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses without performing a full table scan. This drastically reduces I/O operations and query execution time for read-heavy workloads.\n\nTrade-offs: While indexes speed up reads (SELECT), they slow down writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must also be updated. They also consume additional disk space. Over-indexing or poorly designed indexes can degrade overall performance, so they must be created strategically based on query analysis.",
      "is_correct": true,
      "partial_credit": 1.0,
      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "Assessment: Correct. The student's answer correctly provides a technical definition of database indexing, explains its purpose of speeding up data retrieval, and clearly outlines the key trade-offs, including increased storage usage and slower write operations. All requirements of the question for the 'Engineer' role were met."
