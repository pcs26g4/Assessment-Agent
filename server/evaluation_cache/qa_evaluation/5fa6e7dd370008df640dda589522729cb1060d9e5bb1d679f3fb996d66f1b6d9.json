      "feedback": "Score: 0.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's code is logically incorrect. The `else` statement is misplaced inside the `for` loop, which causes the program to print 'Element not found' for every item it checks that is not the target. The correct logic, demonstrated in the reference materials, is to check the entire array and only print a 'not found' message if the loop completes without finding the target element. Because the submitted code's logic contradicts the logic in the reference materials, it is marked as incorrect."
