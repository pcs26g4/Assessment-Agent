The question provided for grading is 'Q5: What is 15% of 200?', but the official reference key indicates that Question 5 should be 'Which protocol is used for secure web browsing?'. Because the wrong question was answered for this number, no credit can be awarded. The correct answer for the expected Question 5 is 'API\u2019s'."
