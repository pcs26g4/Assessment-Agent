      "feedback": "The submitted code is incorrect and would not compile or run successfully. It contains multiple syntax and logical errors.\n\n1.  **Syntax Errors:**\n    *   `in n = size of(arr) / size of(arr[0]);` should be `int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);`. The keywords `int` and `sizeof` are incorrect.\n    *   The `for` loop syntax `for init (i=); i<n; i++)` is invalid. The correct syntax is `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`.\n    *   There is a stray period in the condition `if (arr[i] > largest.)`.\n    *   The line `largest = arr[i]` is missing a semicolon at the end.\n\n2.  **Logical Errors:**\n    *   The code's logic is designed to find the `largest` number, but the final `printf` statement attempts to print a variable named `smallest`, which is never declared or calculated.\n    *   The output message `\"Smallest number: ...\"` is misleading as the algorithm finds the largest number.\n    *   The format specifier `%.f` is for floating-point numbers, but the variable being printed should be an integer (`%d`).\n\nDue to these fundamental errors, the code is non-functional."
