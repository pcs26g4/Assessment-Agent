      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "A grammatically correct answer would use proper articles and phrasing. For example: 'As an Engineer: Database indexing is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space.' The other sentences should also be well-formed and free of grammatical errors.",

      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The evaluation is based on the provided rubric, which focuses on grammar and sentence formation. The answer contains several grammatical errors. For instance, 'As a Engineer' should be 'As an Engineer'. The heading 'CEO\u2019s Answer:' is grammatically awkward in this context; 'For the CEO:' would be more appropriate. While the sentences are simple and understandable, these errors prevent the answer from receiving full marks based on the specified grading criteria."
