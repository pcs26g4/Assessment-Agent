      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "Engineer: Database indexing is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. Its purpose is to minimize disk I/O by providing a quick lookup mechanism. The trade-off is that it consumes extra storage space and can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) since the index also needs to be updated.\n\nProduct Manager: For our product, indexing is key to a positive user experience. It makes data-heavy features load almost instantly, which keeps users engaged and reduces bounce rates. As we scale our user base, proper indexing ensures the app remains fast and responsive, directly impacting user satisfaction and retention.\n\nProduct Salesperson: Our system's speed and responsiveness are major selling points, and database indexing is the technology that makes it possible. For the customer, this means no frustrating load times and a smooth workflow, which translates to higher productivity. This performance is a key differentiator that provides tangible business value.\n\nCEO: Database indexing is a strategic technical investment that ensures our platform's scalability and protects our revenue. By maintaining high performance as we grow, we enhance customer retention and fortify our brand's reputation for reliability. This allows us to scale our operations efficiently without compromising the user experience, which is critical for long-term market leadership and profitability.",

      "feedback": "The student provided a very basic, high-level explanation for each role. While the core idea that indexing improves speed is correct, the answer fails to address the specific, detailed requirements outlined in the question for each role. For the Engineer, there is no mention of trade-offs. For the Product Manager, Salesperson, and CEO, the explanations lack the required depth regarding scalability, business impact, customer value, and strategic importance. The answers are too brief and do not demonstrate a full understanding of how to tailor the communication to each specific audience as requested."
