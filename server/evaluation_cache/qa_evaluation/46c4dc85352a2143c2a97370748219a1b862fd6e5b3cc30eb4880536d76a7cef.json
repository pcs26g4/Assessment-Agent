      "feedback": "The student's answer is correct. The time complexity for a linear search is O(n), as the algorithm may need to check every element in the input of size 'n' in the worst-case scenario. The provided reference material, which finds the largest number in an array, is an example of an algorithm with O(n) complexity."
