      "correct_answer": "The provided C code demonstrates one way to solve this. The core logic is to initialize a variable `largest` with the first element of the array. Then, loop through the remaining elements, and if an element is found to be greater than `largest`, update `largest` with that element's value. A correct implementation in C would be:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {10, 45, 3, 99, 23};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int largest = arr[0];\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        if (arr[i] > largest) {\n            largest = arr[i];\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"Largest number: %d\", largest);\n    return 0;\n}",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer correctly implements the algorithm to find the largest number in an array. The logic of initializing a variable with the first element and then iterating through the array to find a larger value perfectly matches the logic in the reference material. The use of Python instead of C is acceptable as no specific language was required."
