      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student was asked to provide the logic for a linear search, and their C code correctly and completely implements this algorithm. The provided reference material showed code for finding the largest element in an array, which is a different algorithm. According to grading rules, this unrelated reference material was ignored, and the student's answer was evaluated based on its correctness in fulfilling the question's prompt. The student's logic is sound, and they have earned full marks."
