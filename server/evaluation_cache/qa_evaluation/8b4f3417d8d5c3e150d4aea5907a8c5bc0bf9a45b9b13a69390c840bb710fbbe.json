      "correct_answer": "a) Log Transformation: The correct formula is s = c * log(1 + r), where 'r' is the input pixel intensity and 'c' is a scaling constant. For example, using natural log and c=1, for an input pixel r=16, the output s = log(1 + 16) = log(17) \u2248 2.83. The student's calculation of log(16)=4 is incorrect.\n\nb) Power-Law Transformation: The correct formula is s = c * r^\u03b3, where 'c' and '\u03b3' are constants. For example, if c=1 and \u03b3=0.5 (square root), for an input pixel r=16, the output s = 1 * 16^0.5 = 4. The student's final matrix does not correspond to this transformation.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the required image transformations.\n\nFor the log transformation, the calculations are incorrect. For example, log(16) is not 4 unless the base is 2, and even then, the formula used is wrong. The correct formula is s = c * log(1 + r). The student seems to have confused the logarithm with the square root function.\n\nFor the power-law transformation, while the general formula is mentioned, the application and the final resulting matrix are unclear and do not seem to be derived correctly from the input values."
