      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The question asks for the logic of a linear search. The provided reference material contains code for finding the largest element in an array, which is a different algorithm and therefore irrelevant to the question. The student's answer correctly implements the logic for a linear search in C++. Full credit is awarded as the student correctly answered the question posed in the assignment description."
