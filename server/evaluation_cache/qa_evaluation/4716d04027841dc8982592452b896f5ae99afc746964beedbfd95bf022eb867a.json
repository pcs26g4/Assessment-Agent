      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The final output size of 22x22 is correct, and the calculation `28-7+1 = 22` is also correct. However, the formula you wrote, `(i/p size - kenral size) / stride`, is incorrect as it is missing the `+1` term. The correct formula is `(Input Size - Kernel Size) / Stride + 1`. Due to the conceptual error in the formula provided, full marks cannot be awarded."
