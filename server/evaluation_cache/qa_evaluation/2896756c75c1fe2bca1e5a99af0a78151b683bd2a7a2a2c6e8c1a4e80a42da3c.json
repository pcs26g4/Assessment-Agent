      "student_answer": "arr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",
      "correct_answer": "The correct logic is to initialize a variable (e.g., 'largest') with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the array, and for each element, compare it to the 'largest' variable. If the current element is greater than 'largest', update 'largest' to the value of that element. After the loop, the 'largest' variable will hold the maximum value.",
      "is_correct": true,
      "partial_credit": 1.0,
      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The student's answer correctly implements the logic for finding the largest number in an array. The provided Python code correctly initializes a 'largest' variable with the first element and then iterates through the array, updating the variable whenever a greater value is found. This algorithm is logically identical to the one presented in the C code reference material. The difference in programming language is acceptable as the core logic is correct."
