      "question": "Q5. Explain virtualization in cloud computing.",
      "student_answer": "Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server. It maximizes hardware utilization and reduces operational costs. Hypervisors manage virtual machines and allocate resources dynamically. Virtualization supports scalability, fault isolation, and disaster recovery. It is a core technology behind cloud computing platforms and enables efficient resource management.",
      "correct_answer": "The provided reference material is for a mathematics question on image intensity transformations and does not contain an answer for a question about cloud computing virtualization.",

      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The student's answer explains cloud computing virtualization. However, the provided reference material and rubric are for a completely different subject: image intensity transformations (log and power-law transformations). The answer is graded as incorrect because it does not relate to the provided academic context and reference key."
