      "feedback": "The submitted code contains multiple critical syntax and logical errors that prevent it from compiling and producing the correct result. While the core idea of comparing elements in a loop is present, the implementation is incorrect.\n\nErrors found:\n1.  **Syntax Errors:** The code will not compile. Examples include `in` instead of `int`, `size of` instead of `sizeof()`, an invalid `for` loop structure `for init (i=);`, a period after the variable `largest.`, and a missing semicolon after `largest = arr[i]`.\n2.  **Logical Error:** The program is supposed to find the largest number, but the final print statement attempts to print the \"Smallest number\".\n3.  **Undeclared Variable:** The `printf` function tries to print a variable named `smallest`, which was never declared or assigned a value.\n4.  **Incorrect Format Specifier:** The `printf` function uses `%.f`, which is for floating-point numbers, but the variable should be an integer (`%d`)."
