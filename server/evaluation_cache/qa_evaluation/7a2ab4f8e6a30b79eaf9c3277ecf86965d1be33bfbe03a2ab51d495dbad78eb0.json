      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct answer would provide detailed, role-specific explanations as follows:\n\n**Engineer:** Database indexing is a data structure, like a B-tree, that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. Its purpose is to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a table every time. The key trade-off is that while it speeds up read queries (SELECT), it slows down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index also needs to be updated.\n\n**Product Manager:** For our product, database indexing is crucial for delivering a fast and responsive user experience. It directly reduces data loading times, which means users aren't left waiting. This is critical for scalability; as our user base and data grow, indexing ensures the product remains performant, which positively impacts user satisfaction, engagement, and retention.\n\n**Product Salesperson:** Our system's speed and responsiveness are major selling points, and database indexing is a core technology that makes this possible. For the customer, this means they get instant access to their information, leading to higher productivity and satisfaction. This performance is a key competitive differentiator, providing tangible business value by ensuring a smooth, professional user experience.\n\n**CEO:** Database indexing is a strategic technical investment that ensures our platform is scalable and efficient. By optimizing our data retrieval, we can handle significant user growth without a proportional increase in infrastructure costs. This directly impacts the bottom line by improving operational efficiency and has a major business impact by protecting our brand's reputation for performance and reliability, which is crucial for long-term customer retention and market leadership.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The student's answers are far too brief and lack the specific details required for each role. While the general idea (speed) is mentioned, the core requirements of the prompt were missed.\n\n- **For the Engineer:** The answer provides a basic definition but completely omits the required discussion of trade-offs (e.g., slower writes, increased storage).\n- **For the Product Manager:** The answer touches on user experience but fails to address scalability or the broader product impact.\n- **For the Product Salesperson:** The answer mentions customer value (a fast system) but does not explain the resulting business benefits.\n- **For the CEO:** The answer is a simple statement that does not explain the strategic importance, scalability implications, or overall business impact as requested."
