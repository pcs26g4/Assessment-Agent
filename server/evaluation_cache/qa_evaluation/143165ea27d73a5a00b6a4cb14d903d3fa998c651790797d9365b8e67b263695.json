      "question": "Explain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.\n\nd) For a CEO:",
      "student_answer": "Database indexing improves system efficiency and scalability. Faster data access enhances customer experience, reduces operational issues, and supports business growth",
      "correct_answer": "Database indexing is a foundational architectural decision that enables sustainable system performance. It allows the organization to scale users, transactions, and data complexity without linear increases in infrastructure cost. Strategically, it ensures performance is engineered into the platform, not added later as a costly fix.",

      "feedback": "Graded against Reference Key. The student's answer correctly identifies some high-level benefits like efficiency and scalability. However, it lacks the specific strategic framing required for a CEO as outlined in the reference answer. The answer misses key points about indexing being a 'foundational architectural decision,' its impact on avoiding 'linear increases in infrastructure cost,' and the strategic importance of engineering performance into the platform proactively."
