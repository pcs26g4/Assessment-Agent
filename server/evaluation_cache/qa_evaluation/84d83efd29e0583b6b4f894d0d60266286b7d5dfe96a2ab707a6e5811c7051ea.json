However, the question, when interpreted with the rubric, requires a 'comprehensive THEORY assessment' focusing on 'conceptual clarity, depth, and keyword accuracy'. The submission is a practical implementation, not a theoretical evaluation. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the question."
