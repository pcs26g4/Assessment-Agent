      "question": "Explain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "a) For an Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a data structure technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. An index works similarly to a lookup table, allowing the database engine to locate rows efficiently without performing a full table scan. Indexes are typically implemented using data structures such as B-trees or hash tables. While indexing improves read performance, it introduces overhead during write operations.\n\nb) For a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing helps systems fetch data faster, improving application performance and user experience. It supports faster page loads, smoother workflows, and better scalability as the user base grows, while balancing cost and maintenance.\n\nc) For a Product Salesperson:\n\nDatabase indexing enables faster data access, improving response time and customer satisfaction. It allows applications to handle more users efficiently, making the product more competitive.\n\nd) For a CEO:\n\nDatabase indexing improves system efficiency and scalability. Faster data access enhances customer experience, reduces operational issues, and supports business growth",
      "correct_answer": "A correct answer should provide four distinct explanations for database indexing, each tailored to the specified role.\n- Engineer: A technical explanation covering data structures (e.g., B-trees), the purpose of avoiding full table scans for faster reads, and the trade-off of slower write operations.\n- Product Manager: An explanation focused on product outcomes, such as improved user experience (faster load times), scalability to support more users, and the impact on product performance metrics.\n- Product Salesperson: A value-focused explanation emphasizing customer benefits like speed and satisfaction, and competitive advantages like superior performance and reliability.\n- CEO: A high-level, strategic explanation linking indexing to business goals like operational efficiency, scalability for growth, enhanced customer retention, and overall business impact.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The provided reference material was on an unrelated topic (C programming) and was therefore ignored as per grading instructions. The evaluation was based on the assignment description's requirement for a 'THEORY assessment' and the specific constraints of the question. The student provided accurate, distinct, and role-appropriate explanations for all four roles (Engineer, Product Manager, Salesperson, CEO), demonstrating excellent conceptual clarity and depth as required by the rubric. Each explanation correctly tailored the concept of database indexing to the specified audience's perspective."
