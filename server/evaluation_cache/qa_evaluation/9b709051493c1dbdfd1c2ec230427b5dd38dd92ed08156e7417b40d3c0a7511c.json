      "feedback": "The student's answer was evaluated against the assignment description, which required writing a program for a linear search, as the provided reference material for Q1 was on a different topic. The provided code attempts to implement a linear search but contains a critical error. The 'for' loop condition 'i <= n' is incorrect. For an array of size 'n' (5 in this case), the valid indices are 0 to 4 (n-1). The loop will attempt to access arr[5], which is out of the array's bounds, leading to undefined behavior or a program crash. The correct condition should be 'i < n'."
