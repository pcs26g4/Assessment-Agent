Later in the talk, he emphasizes that he is gesticulating and pacing as though he is building to some sort of satisfying conclusion, while simultaneously \"growing in intensity\".\n\n* Beckoning: He uses a forceful visual cue, stating he will \"really beckon\" to make a point seem intellectual.\n\n* Changing Tone and Pace: To create the impression of a significant moment, the speaker slows down the delivery and changes the tone, making it seem like he is \u201cbuilding to a moment\u201d.\n\nAttire and Props\n\n* Glasses: The speaker uses glasses as a prop to visually project intelligence. He admits he wore them \u201cto look smart,\u201d even though they are merely frames and his vision is perfect. He uses them non-verbally by adjusting his glasses and later dramatically taking them off as he slows the talk down.\n\nVisual Aids and Data\n\nThe speaker utilizes visual aids to give the impression that he has performed the necessary preparation and research, or \u201cdone [his] homework\u201d.\n\n* Slides and Background Images: The presentation includes slides that feature \u201cwords paired with vaguely thought-provoking stock photos\u201d. The speaker actively points at these images to create the appearance of making effective use of time. He also incorporates an image of a man found by googling the word \u201cScientist\u201d to give the discussion intellectual weight.\n\n* Graphs and Charts: Graphs are used to display irrelevant data, including a pie chart that simply shows \u201cthat the majority far exceeds the minority,\u201d and a bar graph showing \u201csimilarly irrelevant data\u201d.\n\n* Numbers: He presents various real numbers, such as measurements, mathematical facts (2x6=12), and large quantities (2.6 million), which serve as filler and contribute to the appearance of using data.\n\nThe speaker notes that these collective non-verbal cues are so effective that if someone were watching the video on YouTube \u201cwith the sound off,\u201d they might automatically assume, \u201cThis guy knows what he\u2019s talking about",
