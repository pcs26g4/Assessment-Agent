      "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",
      "correct_answer": "For an engineer, a correct explanation of database indexing should define it as a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. The purpose is to avoid full table scans by allowing the database engine to quickly locate rows based on the values in indexed columns. Key trade-offs include increased storage consumption for the index itself and slower write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must also be updated.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is excellent. It correctly provides a definition of database indexing, explains its purpose in speeding up data retrieval, and clearly outlines the trade-offs, including storage space and impact on write operations. The explanation is well-structured, technically accurate, and perfectly tailored for an engineer, fulfilling all aspects of the question. The grammar and sentence formation are also flawless."
