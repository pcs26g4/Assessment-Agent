      "correct_answer": "The correct answer requires performing calculations for both the log transformation (part a) and the power-law transformation (part b). The reference key provides sample calculations for part (a) (e.g., for r=1, s = log(1+1) = 1; for r=2, s = log(1+2) = 1.585) and for part (b) (e.g., for r=1, s = 2 * 1^\u03b3 = 2). It also provides a final output matrix, which corresponds to the power-law transformation.",

The student correctly provided several sample calculations for the log transformation (part a) and the final output matrix, which match the reference key. However, the answer is incomplete because it omits any mention or calculation for the power-law transformation (part b), which was explicitly required by the question."
