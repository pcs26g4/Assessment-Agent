      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student has correctly identified the time complexity of linear search as O(n). The answer is accurate and uses the standard Big O notation, demonstrating conceptual clarity and keyword accuracy as per the rubric."
