      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. You have correctly applied the standard formula for calculating the output dimension of a convolutional layer. However, the formula provided in the question was non-standard, ending with `+2` instead of the conventional `+1`. You used `+1` in your calculation, which led to the result of 29. According to the specific formula given in the question, the correct calculation should have been (63 - 7 + 2*0) / 2 + 2 = 30."
