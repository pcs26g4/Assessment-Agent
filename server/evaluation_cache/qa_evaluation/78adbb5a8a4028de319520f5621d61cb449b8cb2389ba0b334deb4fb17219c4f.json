It should iterate through the elements, and if the target is found, print its index and terminate. If the loop completes without finding the target, it should indicate that the element was not found. The provided reference solutions demonstrate this in C++ and C.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's submission correctly implements the linear search algorithm shown in the reference materials. Although the submission is in Python and the references are in C++ and C, the grading rubric allows for language independence as long as the core logic is the same. The student's code is syntactically correct for Python and successfully finds the target element at the correct index, matching the expected outcome."
