      "feedback": "Score: 0.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The submission received a score of 0.0 because it addresses a completely different problem than the one specified in the reference material. The reference material provides an example of a linear search algorithm to find a specific target value in an array. The submitted code, however, attempts to find the largest element in an array, which is a different task. This is a fundamental topic mismatch. Furthermore, the submitted C code contains multiple syntax and logical errors and would not compile or run correctly."
