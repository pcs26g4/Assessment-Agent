      "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer is a verbatim match to the provided reference material for the explanation tailored to an Engineer. The answer correctly defines database indexing, explains its purpose (performance optimization), and details the trade-offs (storage, write impact), which aligns perfectly with the requirements for the Engineer role as specified in the rubric."
