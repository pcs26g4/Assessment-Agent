      "question": "Q2. Explain the concept of normalization in DBMS.",
      "student_answer": "Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them. The goal is to eliminate anomalies during insert, update, and delete operations. The first normal form ensures atomic values. Second normal form removes partial dependency. Third normal form eliminates transitive dependency. Higher normal forms further optimize data storage.\nNormalization improves consistency and reduces duplication. However, excessive normalization can affect performance. Therefore, a balance between normalization and denormalization is often required in real-world applications.",

However, the provided reference material is for a completely different subject (Intensity Transformation in image processing) and does not contain an answer key for this question. According to the grading instructions, the evaluation must be based exclusively on the provided reference material. Since the student's answer cannot be verified against the given source, it is marked as incorrect in the context of this specific assignment."
