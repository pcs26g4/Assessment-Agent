      "correct_answer": "A correct answer would be a theoretical explanation of a computer science concept. For instance, explaining the theory behind cycle detection in a linked list would involve discussing Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. This explanation should cover the core concepts: using two pointers, a 'slow' pointer that moves one step at a time and a 'fast' pointer that moves two steps at a time. It should explain that if a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually lap the slow pointer, and they will meet at a 'collision point'. The explanation should focus on the conceptual 'why' this works, rather than just providing the implementation code.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect.\nThe question required a comprehensive THEORY assessment, focusing on conceptual clarity, depth, and keywords. You provided a code implementation instead of a theoretical explanation. While the code itself is a correct implementation of an algorithm, it does not answer the question that was asked, which required a discussion of theory."
