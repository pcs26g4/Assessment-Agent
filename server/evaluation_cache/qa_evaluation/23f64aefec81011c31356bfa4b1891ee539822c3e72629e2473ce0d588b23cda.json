      "correct_answer": "The correct answer should summarize the key points from the three provided sources. 1. Effective business communication involves understanding communication models, structuring communication for results, and practicing professional etiquette (e.g., grooming, meeting practices). 2. Technical communication focuses on audience needs, advocating for the user through clarity, simplicity, and audience analysis to create user-friendly content and reduce company costs. 3. Visual and non-verbal cues, such as hand gestures, pacing, props (like glasses), and visual aids (slides, graphs), can be used to create an illusion of expertise during a presentation, even without substantive content.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer does not address the question asked. The question, based on the provided reference material for Q2, is about business communication, technical communication, and non-verbal cues. The student submitted a C program for a linear search, which is completely unrelated to the question's topic. Therefore, no credit can be awarded. Additionally, the submitted code contains a critical error: the loop condition `i <= n` will cause the program to access an array element out of bounds, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior."
