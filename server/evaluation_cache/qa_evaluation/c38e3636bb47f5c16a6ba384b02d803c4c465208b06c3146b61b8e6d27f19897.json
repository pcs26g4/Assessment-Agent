However, you made an arithmetic error in the final calculation. The correct sum is 6.1, not 7.3. The subsequent calculation for 'Relative Cardinality' was not requested and was also incorrect, as it used the wrong scalar cardinality value and an incorrect count for the number of elements (which is 9, not 13)."
