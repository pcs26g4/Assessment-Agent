      "feedback": "The student's code correctly finds the largest number in the array. However, the evaluation must be performed strictly against the provided Reference Key. The Reference Key, despite containing syntax errors, has a specific logical flow: it calculates the 'largest' value but then attempts to print an undefined variable named 'smallest'. The student's code deviates from this logic by correctly printing the 'largest' variable. According to the grading rules, any deviation from the Reference Key's logic, even if the student's code is functionally correct, must result in a score of 0.0."
