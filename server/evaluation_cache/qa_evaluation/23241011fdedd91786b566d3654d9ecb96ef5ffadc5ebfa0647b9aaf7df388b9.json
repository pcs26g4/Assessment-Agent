      "feedback": "The student's submission does not address the problem specified in the reference material. The reference material provides a Python script to find the largest number in an array. The student submitted a C++ program that performs a linear search for a specific element in an array. Although the submitted C++ code is syntactically correct for a linear search, it solves a completely different problem. Therefore, no credit can be awarded as the core logic does not match the assignment's requirement."
