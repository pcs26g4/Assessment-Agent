      "correct_answer": "The logic involves initializing a variable 'largest' with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the remaining elements of the array. In each iteration, compare the current element with the 'largest' variable. If the current element is greater, update 'largest' with the current element's value. After the loop, the 'largest' variable will hold the largest number in the array.\n\nExample (Python):\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",

      "feedback": "Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer is correct. The logic for finding the largest number in the array\u2014initializing with the first element and then iterating through the rest of the array to find a larger value\u2014is a substantive match to the C code example provided in the reference material (b9c229ce-6822-4e0f-a454-1f5b4183b2b5.pdf). While the student's code contains minor syntax errors (e.g., 'in' instead of 'int', 'init' instead of 'int') and a final `printf` statement that incorrectly refers to 'smallest', these errors are also present in the reference key. Therefore, full credit is awarded."
