      "correct_answer": "The correct logic is to initialize a variable with the first element of the array, then iterate through the remaining elements. If an element is found to be greater than the current largest value, the variable is updated with that element's value. Example in C:\n\nint largest = arr[0];\nfor (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] > largest) {\n        largest = arr[i];\n    }\n}",

      "feedback": "The student's answer correctly implements the logic for finding the largest number in an array. The provided logic\u2014initializing a 'largest' variable with the first element and then iterating through the array to update it if a larger element is found\u2014is a perfect match for the logic in the reference material. The use of a different programming language (Python) is acceptable as the core algorithm is identical to the one in the C example."
