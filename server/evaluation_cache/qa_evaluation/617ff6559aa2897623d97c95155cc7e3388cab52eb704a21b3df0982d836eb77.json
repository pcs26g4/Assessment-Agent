      "correct_answer": "The correct approach is to implement an algorithm that iterates through a list of numbers, keeping track of the largest value found. A common method is to initialize a 'largest' variable with the first element and then loop through the remaining elements, updating the variable if a larger number is found.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's code correctly implements a standard algorithm to find the largest number in a list. The logic initializes a variable with the first element and then iterates through the list, updating the variable whenever a larger number is encountered. This perfectly aligns with the assignment requirement to 'find the largest number'."
