      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The final output size of 22x22 is correct. However, the formula you wrote, `(input size - kernel size) / stride`, is incorrect. The correct formula is `(Input Size - Kernel Size) / Stride + 1`. While your subsequent calculation `28-7+1 = 22` did lead to the correct numerical result, the explicitly stated formula was wrong, indicating a lack of complete conceptual clarity."
