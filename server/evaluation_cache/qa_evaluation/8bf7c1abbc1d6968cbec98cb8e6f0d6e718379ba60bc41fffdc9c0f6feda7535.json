      "correct_answer": "The correct logic involves initializing a variable `largest` with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the rest of the array, and for each element, compare it with `largest`. If the current element is greater than `largest`, update `largest` to be the current element. A correct C implementation would look like this:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {10, 45, 3, 99, 23};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int largest = arr[0];\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        if (arr[i] > largest) {\n            largest = arr[i];\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"Largest number: %d\", largest);\n    return 0;\n}",

      "feedback": "The core logic of comparing the current array element to find a larger value (`if (arr[i] > largest)`) is conceptually correct for the problem. However, the C code provided has numerous critical syntax errors that make it non-functional and incorrect. Errors include: incorrect variable declaration (`in n`), incorrect use of `sizeof`, completely incorrect `for` loop syntax, a stray character in the `if` condition (`largest.`), a missing semicolon, and an incorrect `printf` statement that refers to the wrong variable (`smallest`), uses the wrong format specifier (`%.f`), and prints the wrong descriptive text (\"Smallest number\"). Due to these severe implementation errors, the code fails to correctly represent the logic."
