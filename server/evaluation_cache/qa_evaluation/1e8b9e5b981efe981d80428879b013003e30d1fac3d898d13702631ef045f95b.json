      "question": "[CATEGORY: CODING] write a program to the linear search",
      "student_answer": "```python\narr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n\ntarget = 30\n\nfor i in range(len(arr)):\n    if arr[i] == target:\n        print(\"Element found at index\", i)\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"Element not found\")\n```",
      "correct_answer": "A correct implementation of a linear search algorithm. The program should iterate through a collection of elements one by one, comparing each element with a target value. If a match is found, it should report the position (index). If the end of the collection is reached without finding the target, it should report that the element was not found.",
      "is_correct": true,

      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The student's answer was evaluated against the assignment description's requirement to 'write a program to the linear search,' as the reference material for 'Q2' was contextually irrelevant to this coding task. The provided Python code is a correct and complete implementation of a linear search algorithm. It successfully iterates through the list, finds the target element, and correctly handles the case where the element is not found using a for-else loop."
