      "feedback": "The student's answer is incorrect. While the search is linear, the notation 'O(n-1)' is not the correct way to express Big O complexity. A fundamental rule of Big O notation is that constant factors and lower-order terms are dropped because the notation describes the growth rate as the input size (n) approaches infinity. Therefore, the correct time complexity for linear search is O(n)."
