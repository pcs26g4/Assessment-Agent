      "question": "Explain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact",
      "student_answer": "b) Explanation for a Product Manager\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a method used to ensure that application data loads quickly and consistently for users.\n\nFunctional Explanation\n\nWhen users search, filter, or view data in an application, indexing allows the system to fetch results faster without delays. Without indexing, the system would need to scan large amounts of data, causing slow response times.\n\nIndexing helps maintain smooth user experiences as the product scales and the data volume increases.\n\nImpact on Product\n\nFaster screen loading and search results\n\nImproved user satisfaction and retention\n\nBetter scalability as user base grows\n\nProduct Manager\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing supports performance-related requirements and helps meet SLAs without changing product features or UI.",
      "correct_answer": "For a Product Manager, database indexing is a crucial back-end technique that directly enhances product performance and user experience. It works like an index in a book, allowing the application to find user data (like searches or profile information) extremely quickly, rather than scanning the entire database. The key impacts for a PM are: 1. Improved User Experience: Faster load times and search results lead to higher user satisfaction and retention. 2. Scalability: As the user base and data grow, indexing ensures the product remains fast and responsive, preventing performance degradation. 3. Product Impact: It's a non-functional requirement that supports key business metrics by making the product feel snappy and reliable, which is essential for meeting performance SLAs and maintaining a competitive edge.",
