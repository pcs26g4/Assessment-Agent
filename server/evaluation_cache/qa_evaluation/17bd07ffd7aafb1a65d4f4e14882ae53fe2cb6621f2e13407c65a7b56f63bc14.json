If an element is found to be greater than the current 'largest' value, 'largest' is updated to that element's value. A correct implementation in C would be:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {10, 45, 3, 99, 23};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int largest = arr[0];\n\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        if (arr[i] > largest) {\n            largest = arr[i];\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"Largest number: %d\", largest);\n    return 0;\n}",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer provides the correct core logic for finding the largest number in an array, which involves initializing a variable and iterating through the array to update it. This logic substantively matches the logic provided in the reference materials. Although the student's code contains several syntax errors (e.g., 'in n', 'init (i=1)') and a critical error in the final printf statement (printing 'smallest' instead of 'largest' with an incorrect label), these errors are also present in one of the provided reference documents. According to the grading rules, if the student's answer matches any part of the reference set, even a flawed part, full credit must be awarded."
