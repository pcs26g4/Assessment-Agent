      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of how to apply the transformations to the given image matrix.\n\nFor part (a), while some individual log calculations are correct (using base-2), they were not applied systematically to the input matrix. The answer is a disorganized list of calculations, including values for pixels not present in the original image (e.g., r=15, r=13), and it fails to present the final transformed image as a matrix.\n\nFor part (b), the formula used for the power-law transformation, `S => Cr^r`, is incorrect. The correct formula is `s = c * r^\u03b3`. Furthermore, the resulting matrix provided in the answer is completely unrelated to the input image in terms of size and values."
