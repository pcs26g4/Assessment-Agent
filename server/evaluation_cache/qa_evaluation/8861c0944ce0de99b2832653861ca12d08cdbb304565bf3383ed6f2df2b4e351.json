The evaluation is based on mathematical correctness, as the provided rubric for Biology and the reference Python script were not relevant to the arithmetic question asked. Following the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication is performed before addition: 2 * 3 = 6, and then 5 + 6 = 11. The student's answer of 11 is correct."
