      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The correct answer is that the weight matrix between the input and output layers has a dimension of 2x6. The student's answer is incorrect because it assumes the existence of a hidden layer with 5 neurons, which was not specified in the question. Furthermore, the formula provided ('Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p') is conceptually wrong and does not correctly determine the dimensions of a weight matrix."
