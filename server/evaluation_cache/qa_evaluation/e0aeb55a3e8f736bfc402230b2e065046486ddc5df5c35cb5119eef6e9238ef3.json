You correctly identified the Center of Area (COA) method and correctly calculated the numerator (4.2) and the denominator (1.4). However, you made an arithmetic error in the final division, as 4.2 / 1.4 = 3, not 3.76. Additionally, a significant portion of your answer contains irrelevant calculations about inputs and weights that do not relate to the question."
