The question asked ('What does SQL stand for?') does not match Question 1 in the reference material ('Which keyword is used to define a function in Python?'). As per the grading rules, a mismatch between the student's question and the reference key question results in a score of 0. Additionally, the student's answer is incorrect; 'mangodb' (MongoDB) is a NoSQL database, whereas SQL stands for 'Structured Query Language'."
