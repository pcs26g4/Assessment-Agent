      "question": "check the logic for the largest number in an array",
      "student_answer": "Name:- Manoj Py\n\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",
      "correct_answer": "The logic involves initializing a variable (e.g., 'largest') with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the rest of the array, comparing each element to the 'largest' variable. If an element is found to be greater than the current 'largest', update the 'largest' variable with that element's value. After the loop finishes, the 'largest' variable will hold the largest value in the array.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is correct. The provided Python code correctly implements the logic for finding the largest number in an array as shown in the reference material. The logic of initializing a 'largest' variable with the first element and then iterating through the array to compare and update it is perfectly replicated."
