      "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",
      "correct_answer": "For an engineer, a database index is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. The purpose is to avoid full table scans by providing a quick lookup mechanism for rows based on the values in indexed columns. The key trade-offs are that while indexes speed up read queries (SELECT), they slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must also be updated, and they consume additional storage space.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is excellent. It correctly provides a technical definition of an index as a data structure, clearly explains its purpose to speed up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans, and accurately lists the critical trade-offs, including increased storage consumption and slower write operations. The explanation is perfectly tailored for an engineer, mentioning concepts like B-Trees and query execution plans."
