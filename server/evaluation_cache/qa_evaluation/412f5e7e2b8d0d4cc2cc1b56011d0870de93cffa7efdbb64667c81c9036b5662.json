      "question": "Explain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles: Engineer - include definition, purpose, and trade-offs; Product Manager - focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact; Product Salesperson - explain customer value and business benefits; CEO - explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact. Each explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Answer: 101",
      "correct_answer": "Engineer: Database indexing creates a data structure (like a B-tree) that maps column values to their data rows, allowing the database to find data without a full table scan. This significantly speeds up read queries (SELECTs with WHERE clauses). The trade-offs are increased storage overhead, slower write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must also be updated, and the need for ongoing maintenance. Product Manager: Indexing is a key technical strategy to ensure our product remains fast and responsive for users, even as their data grows. It directly impacts user experience by keeping search, filtering, and loading times low. This is critical for scalability, user retention, and preventing performance degradation from becoming a major product issue that derails the roadmap. Product Salesperson: Our platform is built for performance at scale. We use advanced techniques like database indexing, which means that no matter how much data your business generates, the application remains snappy and responsive. This translates to a reliable, enterprise-grade experience for your users and ensures the system can handle peak demand without slowing down, giving you a key competitive advantage. CEO: Database indexing is a strategic architectural investment that ensures our platform's long-term scalability and operational efficiency. By building a performant data layer, we can grow our user base and data volume without a proportional increase in infrastructure costs. This enhances our gross margins, improves customer retention through a reliable product, and positions us as a technologically sound and scalable business.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is incorrect. The question provided in the rubric asks for a detailed, role-based explanation of database indexing. The student's answer, '101', is completely unrelated to the question and appears to be an answer to a different question ('What is the binary equivalent of 5?'). The answer does not address any of the requirements outlined in the rubric."
