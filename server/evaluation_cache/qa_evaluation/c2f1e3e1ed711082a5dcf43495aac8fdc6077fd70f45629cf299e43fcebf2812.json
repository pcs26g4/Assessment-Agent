The student's code deviates from the reference key in several critical areas: the `for` loop initialization is incomplete (`for init (i=)`) compared to the reference (`for (init (i=1))`), there is a syntax error in the `if` condition (`largest.`), and a semicolon is missing after the assignment `largest = arr[i]`. According to the strict grading rules, any deviation from the reference material results in a score of 0.0."
