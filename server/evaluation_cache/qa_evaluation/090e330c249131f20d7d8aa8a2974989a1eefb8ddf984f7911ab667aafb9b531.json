      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct answer would provide detailed, role-specific explanations covering all required points:\n\n**Engineer:** Database indexing is a data structure technique used to speed up data retrieval operations on a database table. It works like an index in a book, allowing the database to find rows with specific column values quickly without scanning the entire table. The primary purpose is to improve query performance. However, there are trade-offs: indexes consume extra storage space and can slow down data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index also needs to be updated.\n\n**Product Manager:** For our product, database indexing is a critical component for delivering a fast and responsive user experience. By ensuring quick data retrieval, we reduce loading times and latency, which directly boosts user satisfaction and engagement. As we scale our user base and data volume, proper indexing is essential to maintain performance, preventing the product from becoming slow and unusable. This directly impacts key product metrics like user retention and feature adoption.\n\n**Product Salesperson:** Our product's speed and responsiveness are major selling points, and database indexing is a key technology that makes this possible. For the customer, this means they can access their information instantly without frustrating delays, leading to higher productivity and satisfaction. This performance advantage is a significant business benefit, as it differentiates us from slower competitors and is a core part of the value proposition we offer.\n\n**CEO:** Database indexing is a strategic investment in our technical infrastructure that directly supports our business goals. It ensures our platform can scale efficiently as we grow our customer base and data, protecting our revenue streams by preventing performance degradation. By delivering a superior user experience, it strengthens our brand reputation and competitive position in the market. This is not just a technical detail; it's a foundational element for long-term growth, customer retention, and profitability.",

      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The student provided a very basic, high-level explanation for each role but failed to include the specific details required by the question. The answers are too brief and lack the necessary depth. Points were deducted because key concepts were missing for each role: the Engineer explanation lacks trade-offs; the Product Manager explanation omits scalability and product impact; the Product Salesperson explanation misses explicit business benefits; and the CEO explanation fails to address strategic importance, scalability, or business impact in any meaningful way."
