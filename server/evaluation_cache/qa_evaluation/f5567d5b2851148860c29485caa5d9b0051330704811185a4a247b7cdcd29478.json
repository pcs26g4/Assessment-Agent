      "question": "Explain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.\n\nc) For a Product Salesperson:",
      "student_answer": "Database indexing enables faster data access, improving response time and customer satisfaction. It allows applications to handle more users efficiently, making the product more competitive.",
      "correct_answer": "Database indexing allows the system to retrieve targeted data efficiently without scanning entire datasets. This translates into sub-second response times, stable performance during peak usage, and consistent reliability for enterprise-scale workloads. For customers, it means the platform remains fast even as their data and usage grow.",

      "feedback": "Graded against Reference Key. The student's answer correctly identifies the core benefits of database indexing, such as faster response times and improved efficiency, which align with the reference answer. However, it lacks the specific, impactful language tailored for a salesperson. The reference answer provides more compelling details like 'sub-second response times,' 'stable performance during peak usage,' and 'enterprise-scale workloads,' which are crucial for framing the technical benefit as a clear customer value proposition."
