      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The final calculated output size of 22x22 is correct. However, the formula you wrote, `(i/p size - kenral size) / stride`, is incorrect. The correct formula is `(Input Size - Kernel Size) / Stride + 1`. Points were deducted because the conceptual formula provided was wrong, even though the numerical calculation was correct for a stride of 1."
