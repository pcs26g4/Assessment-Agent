      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect.\nThe goal was to apply two transformations to the given image matrix and provide the resulting output matrices.\n\nFor part (a), you performed some individual calculations correctly using the log transformation formula, but you did not provide the final 3x6 output matrix. Your calculations were disorganized, contained several errors (e.g., for input values 7 and 12), and included calculations for pixel values not present in the original image.\n\nFor part (b), your answer was incorrect. The formula you provided was confused (S => Cr^r with y=0.005), and the output matrix you gave was the wrong size (5x6 instead of 3x6) and contained values that do not correspond to the power-law transformation.\n\nPlease see the correct answer for the detailed calculations and final matrices."
