      "feedback": "The core logic for finding the largest number is correct. You correctly initialized a 'largest' variable with the first element and then iterated through the array to compare and update it. However, the answer has several critical errors. First, there are multiple syntax errors in your C code (e.g., 'in' should be 'int', 'size of' should be 'sizeof', 'init' should be 'int'). More importantly, the final print statement is completely incorrect: it tries to print 'Smallest number' and uses an undeclared variable 'smallest', when the goal was to print the 'largest' number found. Due to the correct core algorithm but flawed implementation and incorrect output, partial credit is awarded."
