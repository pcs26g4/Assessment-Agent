Full marks are awarded because the submission perfectly aligns with the provided correct answer, as per the grading instructions. It should be noted that the reference code itself is non-functional and contains multiple syntax and logical errors (e.g., incorrect keywords 'in' and 'size of', invalid for loop syntax, an incorrect variable and format specifier in the printf statement), but the student has correctly replicated this source material."
