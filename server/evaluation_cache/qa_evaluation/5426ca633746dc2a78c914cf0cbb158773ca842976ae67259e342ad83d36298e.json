      "student_answer": "b) Explanation for a Product Manager\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a method used to ensure that application data loads quickly and consistently for users.\n\nFunctional Explanation\n\nWhen users search, filter, or view data in an application, indexing allows the system to fetch results faster without delays. Without indexing, the system would need to scan large amounts of data, causing slow response times.\n\nIndexing helps maintain smooth user experiences as the product scales and the data volume increases.\n\nImpact on Product\n\nFaster screen loading and search results\n\nImproved user satisfaction and retention\n\nBetter scalability as user base grows\n\nProduct Manager\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing supports performance-related requirements and helps meet SLAs without changing product features or UI.",
      "correct_answer": "A correct explanation for a Product Manager should focus on the business and user-centric benefits of database indexing. It should explain that indexing is a performance optimization technique that makes data retrieval (like searches, filters, or loading user data) significantly faster. Key points to include are: improved user experience (less waiting, snappier interface), enhanced user satisfaction and retention, better product scalability (the application remains fast even as data grows), and meeting performance-related Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The explanation should avoid deep technical details and instead frame indexing as a way to achieve product goals related to performance and growth.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against the Assignment Description and standard academic correctness. The student's answer is excellent. It correctly explains database indexing in a way that is perfectly tailored to a Product Manager's perspective. The explanation rightly focuses on the key areas mentioned in the question: user experience (faster loading, smooth experience), scalability (performance as data volume increases), and product impact (user satisfaction, retention, meeting SLAs). The answer is clear, concise, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the role's priorities."
