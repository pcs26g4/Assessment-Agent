      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The code has a significant logical error. The `else` statement is incorrectly indented within the `for` loop. This causes it to print 'Element not found' for every item that doesn't match the target, rather than printing it only once after checking the entire array. The correct approach is to use a flag or a `for...else` block to handle the 'not found' case after the loop finishes. The syntax is valid and the algorithm is a standard linear search (O(n)), which is acceptable."
