      "student_answer": "a) Explanation for an Engineer\n\nOverview\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance optimization technique used to speed up data retrieval operations in a database.\n\nTechnical Explanation\n\nAn index is a data structure (commonly a B-Tree or Hash structure) that maintains a sorted reference to specific columns in a table. Instead of scanning every row during a query execution (full table scan), the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the required records.\n\nFor example, when a WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clause is applied on indexed columns, the database can directly access matching rows using the index pointer, significantly reducing query execution time.\n\nKey Points\n\nImproves read performance\n\nConsumes additional storage space\n\nSlightly impacts write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) due to index maintenance\n\nMust be designed based on query patterns\n\nEngineer\u2019s Focus\n\nIndexing should be applied strategically by analyzing query execution plans and avoiding over-indexing, which can degrade performance.",
