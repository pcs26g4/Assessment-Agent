      "question": "[CATEGORY: THEORY] check the logic for the largest number",
      "student_answer": "Name:- Manoj Py\n\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",
      "correct_answer": "The correct logic involves initializing a variable (e.g., 'largest') with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the rest of the array, and for each element, compare it with the 'largest' variable. If the current element is greater than 'largest', update 'largest' to be the current element. The provided C code in the reference material shows the logic for finding the smallest number, which can be adapted by changing the comparison from '<' to '>'.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student correctly provided the logic to find the largest number in an array. The algorithm correctly initializes a 'largest' variable and iterates through the list, updating the variable when a larger number is found. This directly answers the question. While the reference material showed the logic for finding the smallest number, the student successfully demonstrated understanding by providing the correct corresponding logic for the largest number."
