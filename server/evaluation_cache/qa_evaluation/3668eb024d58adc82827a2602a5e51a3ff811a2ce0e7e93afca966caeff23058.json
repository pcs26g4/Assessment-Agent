      "question": "Explain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.\n\nb) For a Product Manager:",
      "student_answer": "Database indexing helps systems fetch data faster, improving application performance and user experience. It supports faster page loads, smoother workflows, and better scalability as the user base grows, while balancing cost and maintenance.",
      "correct_answer": "Database indexing is a backend optimization that directly influences feature performance at scale. It ensures that as data volume increases, user-facing operations remain predictable and fast, rather than degrading over time. From a roadmap perspective, proper indexing de-risks growth, supports analytics-heavy features, and reduces performance-related production issues.",

      "feedback": "Graded against Reference Key. The student's answer correctly identifies the general benefits of indexing, such as improved performance, user experience, and scalability. However, it lacks the specific, role-tailored concepts required for a Product Manager's perspective as outlined in the reference answer. The correct answer connects indexing directly to product-level concerns like feature performance at scale, roadmap planning, de-risking growth, and enabling specific features, which were missing from the student's explanation."
