      "correct_answer": "The correct answer requires a valid implementation of a linear search algorithm. This involves iterating through an array from the beginning, comparing each element to a target value. If the target is found, the search stops and reports success (e.g., by returning the index). If the end of the array is reached without finding the target, it reports failure.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The question asks for the logic of a linear search. The provided reference material contains code for finding the largest element in an array, which is a different algorithm and thus irrelevant to this specific question. The student's answer provides a correct and complete implementation of a linear search algorithm. The code correctly iterates through the array, compares each element to the target, and accurately reports if the element is found and at which index. Full marks are awarded."
