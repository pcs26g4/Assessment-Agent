      "correct_answer": "The correct answer requires applying the specified image transformation formulas to each pixel value in the given matrix.\n\na) For the log transformation with c=1, the formula is s = 1 * log(1 + r), where 'r' is the input pixel intensity. For example, for the first pixel r=1, the output is s = log(1+1) = log(2). This calculation must be performed for every pixel in the matrix.\n\nb) For the power-law transformation with c=2, the formula is s = 2 * r^\u03b3, where 'r' is the input pixel intensity and \u03b3 is the gamma value (not specified in the question, but a value must be used). For example, for the first pixel r=1, the output would be s = 2 * 1^\u03b3 = 2. This calculation must be performed for every pixel.",

The provided solution is a Python script for a linear search algorithm, which is entirely unrelated to the question about performing log and power-law transformations on an image matrix. The answer does not address the question in any way."
