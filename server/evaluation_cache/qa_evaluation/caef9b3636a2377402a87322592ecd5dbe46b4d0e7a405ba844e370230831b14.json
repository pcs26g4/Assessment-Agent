      "correct_answer": "The correct logic involves initializing a 'largest' variable, typically with the first element of the array. Then, iterate through the array, comparing each element to the current 'largest' value. If an element is found to be greater, it becomes the new 'largest'. The provided Python code is a correct implementation: `arr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]; largest = arr[0]; for num in arr: if num > largest: largest = num; print(\"Largest number:\", largest)`.",
