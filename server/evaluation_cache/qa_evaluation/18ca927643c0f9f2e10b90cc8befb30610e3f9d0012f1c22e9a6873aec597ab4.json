      "question": "What is the time complexity of linear search?",
      "student_answer": "O(n)",
      "correct_answer": "The time complexity of linear search is O(n) (Big O of n), representing linear time. This is because in the worst-case scenario, every element in the list of size 'n' must be checked.",

      "max_marks": 1.0,
      "feedback": "The student's answer is correct. The time complexity of a linear search algorithm is O(n) because, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm may need to iterate through every single element ('n') in the data structure to find the target value. The answer provided, 'O(n)', accurately represents this complexity."
