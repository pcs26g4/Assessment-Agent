The provided reference material was for finding the largest element in an array and was not relevant to the question, which asks for the logic of a linear search. The evaluation is therefore based on the correctness of the student's linear search implementation. The student's code contains a critical logical error in the for loop condition: `for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)`. For an array of size `n` (where n=5), the valid indices are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The loop condition `i <= n` will cause the loop to run for `i=5`, attempting to access `arr[5]`, which is an out-of-bounds memory access. This is a fundamental error in the algorithm's implementation, resulting in an incorrect solution."
