      "correct_answer": "The logic should initialize a variable (e.g., 'largest') with the first element of the array. Then, it should iterate through the array, comparing each element to the 'largest' variable. If an element is found to be greater, the 'largest' variable is updated with that element's value. A correct implementation is provided in the reference material:\narr = [10, 45, 3, 99, 23]\nlargest = arr[0]\nfor num in arr:\n    if num > largest:\n        largest = num\nprint(\"Largest number:\", largest)",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student's answer is correct because it is an exact, verbatim match to one of the provided reference documents (3c749331-bbac-4094-b8a6-3648b8775ec1.pdf). The logic for finding the largest number in the array is implemented correctly."
