      "feedback": "Assessment: Incorrect. The provided code attempts to implement Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm but contains a critical logical error. The fast pointer must move two steps at a time for the algorithm to detect a cycle. Your implementation moves the fast pointer only one step (`fast = fast.next;`), which is the same speed as the slow pointer. This defeats the purpose of the algorithm, as the pointers will not correctly detect a cycle. The correct line should be `fast = fast.next.next;`."
