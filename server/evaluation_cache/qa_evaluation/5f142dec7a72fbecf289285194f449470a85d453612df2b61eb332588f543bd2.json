      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "Data Base Indexing\n\nAs a Engineer:\n\nDatabase indexing is basically a data structure that helps the database find records faster.\n\nAs a Product Manager:\n\nDatabase indexing is what helps our product load data quickly for users.\n\nAs a Product Sales Person:\n\nDatabase indexing is one of the reasons our system feels fast and smooth.\n\nCEO\u2019s Answer:\n\nDatabase indexing is a performance enabler.",
      "correct_answer": "Engineer: Database indexing is a data structure (e.g., B-Tree) that speeds up data retrieval. The purpose is to avoid full table scans. The trade-offs are that it consumes additional storage and slightly slows down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n\nProduct Manager: Indexing ensures a fast and responsive user experience by making data loading and searches quick. This is crucial for scalability as the user base grows, and it positively impacts user satisfaction and retention.\n\nProduct Salesperson: Indexing provides customer value by ensuring the product is fast, reliable, and performs well at scale. This is a business benefit that serves as a competitive advantage and strengthens performance claims.\n\nCEO: Indexing is a strategic investment that supports business scalability and growth. It ensures a positive customer experience, which protects brand reputation, and it helps manage infrastructure costs as the company expands.",

      "feedback": "The student's answer is incorrect because it is superficial and fails to meet the specific requirements for each role as outlined in the question and reference material. The explanations are not tailored or detailed. For the Engineer, the required 'trade-offs' (storage cost, write performance) are missing. For the Product Manager, the answer omits the key concepts of 'scalability' and 'product impact'. For the Product Salesperson, it fails to explain 'customer value' and 'business benefits'. For the CEO, it does not address 'strategic importance', 'scalability', or 'business impact'. Because the core requirements for every part of the question were missed, no credit can be awarded."
