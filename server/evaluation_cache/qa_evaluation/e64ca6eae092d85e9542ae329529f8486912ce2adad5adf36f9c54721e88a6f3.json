The correct answer is: Assuming a direct connection between the input and output layers (no hidden layer), the weight matrix would have dimensions of (number of output neurons) x (number of input neurons), which is 2x6. Your answer was incorrect because it assumed the existence of a hidden layer with 5 neurons, which was not specified in the question. Additionally, the formula provided ('Rows = no. of neurons - neuron in i/p') is conceptually wrong for determining the dimensions of a weight matrix."
