      "feedback": "Assessment: Partially Correct. The correct answer is that Scalar Cardinality of a fuzzy set A is the sum of the membership grades of all the elements of the set. The formula is: |A| = \u03a3_{x \u2208 X} \u03bc_A(x). Your answer correctly demonstrates the calculation by summing up membership values (e.g., '... = 7.3'). However, you did not provide a clear textual definition. The formula you wrote, '\u03a3_{x \u2208 A} \u03bc(x) = A', is also slightly incorrect; the sum equals the cardinality |A|, not the set A itself. The additional calculation for Relative Cardinality was not required."
