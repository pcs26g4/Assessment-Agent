      "feedback": "The student's answer is incorrect. \n\nFor part (a), the student provided some calculations but did not produce the final transformed matrix. The calculations shown also include values not present in the input image (e.g., r=15), indicating they were likely copied from the reference material without understanding.\n\nFor part (b), no calculations were provided. \n\nThe final matrix presented in the answer has dimensions of 5x6, which does not match the 3x6 input image, and its values do not correspond to either of the requested transformations. This matrix appears to be copied directly from the flawed reference material."
