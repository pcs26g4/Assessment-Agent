      "correct_answer": "A correct solution involves an algorithm to iterate through a list of numbers and identify the one with the highest value. A common method is to initialize a variable with the first number in the list and then loop through the remaining numbers, updating the variable whenever a larger number is found.",

      "feedback": "Score: 1.0/1.0. Graded against Reference Key and Assignment Description. The student provided a correct and functional algorithm to find the largest number in a given list. The logic of initializing a 'largest' variable and then iterating through the list to compare and update it is a standard and correct approach to solving this problem."
