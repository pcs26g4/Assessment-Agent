      "question": "Task 1: Audience-Based Communication\n\nExplain the concept of Database Indexing by clearly tailoring your explanation for each of the following roles:\n\nEngineer \u2013 include definition, purpose, and trade-offs\n\nProduct Manager \u2013 focus on user experience, scalability, and product impact\n\nProduct Salesperson \u2013 explain customer value and business benefits\n\nCEO \u2013 explain strategic importance, scalability, and business impact\n\nEach explanation must be role-appropriate, distinct, and clearly differentiated.",
      "student_answer": "a) Engineer\u2019s Explanation (Implementation & Trade-offs)\n\nDatabase indexing is the process of creating secondary data structures\u2014commonly B-tree or hash-based\u2014that allow the query optimizer to avoid full table scans.\nBy indexing selective columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses, we reduce I/O operations, improve execution plans, and lower query latency.\nHowever, indexes introduce write amplification, additional memory usage, and require careful tuning to avoid over-indexing.\n\nb) Product Manager\u2019s Explanation (System Behavior & Scalability)\n\nDatabase indexing is a backend optimization that directly influences feature performance at scale.\nIt ensures that as data volume increases, user-facing operations remain predictable and fast, rather than degrading over time.\nFrom a roadmap perspective, proper indexing de-risks growth, supports analytics-heavy features, and reduces performance-related production issues.\n\nc) Product Sales Person\u2019s Explanation (Technical Benefits Framed as Value)\n\nDatabase indexing allows the system to retrieve targeted data efficiently without scanning entire datasets.\nThis translates into sub-second response times, stable performance during peak usage, and consistent reliability for enterprise-scale workloads.\nFor customers, it means the platform remains fast even as their data and usage grow.\n\nd) CEO\u2019s Explanation (Architecture-Level Decision Making)\n\nDatabase indexing is a foundational architectural decision that enables sustainable system performance.\nIt allows the organization to scale users, transactions, and data complexity without linear increases in infrastructure cost.\nStrategically, it ensures performance is engineered into the platform, not added later as a costly fix.",

However, the official reference material provided for grading is a Java code snippet for detecting a cycle in a linked list. As per the evaluation rules, the student's answer must be compared exclusively against the reference material. Since the question and the student's answer address a topic that is not present in the reference key, no marks can be awarded."
