      "feedback": "The student's answer is correct. O(n) is the correct Big O notation for the time complexity of a linear search, as in the worst case, the algorithm must iterate through all 'n' elements of the collection. The answer meets the rubric's requirement for keyword accuracy and conceptual clarity."
