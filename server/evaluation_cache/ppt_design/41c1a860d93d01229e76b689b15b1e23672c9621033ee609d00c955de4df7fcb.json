    "success": true,
    "response": {
      "visual_clarity": {
        "score": 65,
        "feedback": "Several slides contain a very high number of text elements (up to 21), which likely leads to clutter and reduces readability. Key messages may be lost in the density of information."
      },
      "layout_balance": {
        "score": 58,
        "feedback": "The balance is inconsistent. Slides with a high shape count (e.g., Slides 5, 8, 9) are likely crowded, with poor use of white space, while others are simpler. This creates an uneven flow."
      },
      "color_consistency": {
        "score": 88,
        "feedback": "A consistent and professional color palette (blues, purples, and white) is used across the slides, creating a cohesive visual identity. This is a strong point of the design."
      },
      "typography": {
        "score": 62,
        "feedback": "With a large number of text boxes on many slides, it is probable that a clear typographic hierarchy is lacking, potentially leading to inconsistent font sizes and difficulty in distinguishing headings from body text."
      },
      "visual_appeal": {
        "score": 70,
        "feedback": "The professional color scheme provides a good foundation, but the overall appeal is diminished by information overload and cluttered layouts on the majority of the slides."
      },
      "design_strengths": [
        "The presentation utilizes a consistent and professional color palette, which helps in creating a unified brand feel.",
        "There is a good mix of text-based slides and slides that incorporate images to support the content."
      ],
      "design_improvements": [
        "Significantly reduce the amount of text and the number of elements on dense slides. Consider breaking complex information across multiple slides to improve clarity.",
        "Improve the use of white space and alignment to create more balanced and organized layouts, which will guide the viewer's eye more effectively.",
        "Establish a stronger visual hierarchy with typography to make the content easier to scan and digest."
      ],
      "design_summary": "The design is built on a strong and consistent color scheme, giving it a professional look. However, its effectiveness is significantly hampered by cluttered layouts and information overload on many slides, which detracts from visual clarity and overall appeal."
