    "response": {
      "visual_clarity": {
        "score": 80,
        "feedback": "The presentation maintains good readability due to a simple color scheme, but some slides are dense with text and shapes, which could risk overwhelming the audience."
      },
      "layout_balance": {
        "score": 75,
        "feedback": "The layout is likely inconsistent. Slides with fewer elements are probably well-balanced, while slides with a high number of shapes (e.g., Slide 3, 8) may appear crowded and lack sufficient white space."
      },
      "color_consistency": {
        "score": 95,
        "feedback": "The presentation uses a highly consistent and professional neutral color palette (shades of beige and grey) throughout, creating a cohesive and sophisticated look."
      },
      "typography": {
        "score": 78,
        "feedback": "While specific font data is unavailable, the professional color scheme suggests a competent approach. However, the large amount of text on some slides may challenge the clarity of the typographic hierarchy."
      },
      "visual_appeal": {
        "score": 85,
        "feedback": "The design has a strong, professional aesthetic due to its sophisticated and consistent color palette. The overall appeal is high, though it may be slightly diminished by content-heavy slides."
      },
      "design_strengths": [
        "Excellent color consistency with a sophisticated, neutral palette.",
        "Consistent use of imagery on each slide enhances visual interest.",
        "The overall design projects a clean, professional, and modern aesthetic."
      ],
      "design_improvements": [
        "Reduce the number of elements on dense slides (e.g., Slides 3, 4, 8) by splitting content across multiple slides to improve clarity.",
        "Increase the use of white space on crowded slides to improve layout balance and readability.",
        "Ensure a clear and consistent typographic hierarchy is maintained on text-heavy slides."
      ],
      "design_summary": "This presentation has a strong and professional design foundation, characterized by an excellent, cohesive color palette and consistent use of imagery. Its primary weakness is information density on several slides, which compromises layout balance and clarity. Simplifying these content-heavy slides would elevate the overall design to an exceptional standard."
